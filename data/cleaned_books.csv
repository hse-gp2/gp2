XG--8X3YDs4C,The Columbia Guide to Contemporary African American Fiction,Darryl Dickson-Carr,Columbia University Press,2005-10-14,"From Ishmael Reed and Toni Morrison to Colson Whitehead and Terry McMillan, Darryl Dickson-Carr offers a definitive guide to contemporary African American literature. This volume-the only reference work devoted exclusively to African American fiction of the last thirty-five years-presents a wealth of factual and interpretive information about the major authors, texts, movements, and ideas that have shaped contemporary African American fiction. In more than 160 concise entries, arranged alphabetically, Dickson-Carr discusses the careers, works, and critical receptions of Alice Walker, Gloria Naylor, Jamaica Kincaid, Charles Johnson, John Edgar Wideman, Leon Forrest, as well as other prominent and lesser-known authors. Each entry presents ways of reading the author's works, identifies key themes and influences, assesses the writer's overarching significance, and includes sources for further research. Dickson-Carr addresses the influence of a variety of literary movements, critical theories, and publishers of African American work. Topics discussed include the Black Arts Movement, African American postmodernism, feminism, and the influence of hip-hop, the blues, and jazz on African American novelists. In tracing these developments, Dickson-Carr examines the multitude of ways authors have portrayed the diverse experiences of African Americans. The Columbia Guide to Contemporary African American Fiction situates African American fiction in the social, political, and cultural contexts of post-Civil Rights era America: the drug epidemics of the 1980s and 1990s and the concomitant ""war on drugs,"" the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement, the struggle for gay rights, feminism, the rise of HIVAIDS, and racism's continuing effects on African American communities. Dickson-Carr also discusses the debates and controversies regarding the role of literature in African American life. The volume concludes with an extensive annotated bibliography of African American fiction and criticism.",Literary Collections,en,292.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XG--8X3YDs4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2005.0,complete

UgZsi_DOKoQC,Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet,"Karen Hellekson, Kristina Busse",McFarland,2014-09-17,"Fans have been responding to literary works since the days of Homer's Odyssey and Euripedes' Medea. More recently, a number of science fiction, fantasy, media, and game works have found devoted fan followings. The advent of the Internet has brought these groups from relatively limited, face-to-face enterprises to easily accessible global communities, within which fan texts proliferate and are widely read and even more widely commented upon. New interactions between readers and writers of fan texts are possible in these new virtual communities. From Star Trek to Harry Potter, the essays in this volume explore the world of fan fiction--its purposes, how it is created, how the fan experiences it. Grouped by subject matter, essays cover topics such as genre intersection, sexual relationships between characters, character construction through narrative, and the role of the beta reader in online communities. The work also discusses the terminology used by creators of fan artifacts and comments on the effects of technological advancements on fan communities.

5Zpq0Rmm7hQC,The Distinction of Fiction,Dorrit Cohn,JHU Press,2000-12,"Winner of the Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for Comparative Literary Studies from the Modern Language Association Winner of the Modern Language Association's Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for Comparative Literary Studies The border between fact and fiction has been trespassed so often it seems to be a highway. Works of history that include fictional techniques are usually held in contempt, but works of fiction that include history are among the greatest of classics. Fiction claims to be able to convey its own unique kinds of truth. But unless a reader knows in advance whether a narrative is fictional or not, judgment can be frustrated and confused. In The Distinction of Fiction, Dorrit Cohn argues that fiction does present specific clues to its fictionality, and its own justifications. Indeed, except in cases of deliberate deception, fiction achieves its purposes best by exercising generic conventions that inform the reader that it is fiction. Cohn tests her conclusions against major narrative works, including Proust's A la Recherche du temps perdu, Mann's Death in Venice, Tolstoy's War and Peace, and Freud's case studies. She contests widespread poststructuralist views that all narratives are fictional. On the contrary, she separates fiction and nonfiction as necessarily distinct, even when bound together. An expansion of Cohn's Christian Gauss lectures at Princeton and the product of many years of labor and thought, The Distinction of Fiction builds on narratological and phenomenological theories to show that boundaries between fiction and history can be firmly and systematically explored.",Literary Criticism,en,214.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5Zpq0Rmm7hQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2000.0,complete
-8iD6iuO-iAC,New Boundaries in Political Science Fiction,"Donald M. Hassler, Clyde Wilcox",Univ of South Carolina Press,2008,"This book offers an interpretation of the evolution of a growing genre in literary, film, and television.As a follow-up to their 1997 collection """"Political Science Fiction"""" Hassler and Wilcox have assembled twenty-four noted international scholars representing diverse fields of inquiry to assess the influential voices and trends from the past decade in """"New Boundaries in Political Science Fiction"""". The terrors and technologies that permeate our daily lives have changed radically in the past decade, further highlighting the underlying speculations on our contested future that remain the core of this genre. In surveying the vast expanse of politically charged science fiction of recent years, the editors posit that the defining dilemma for these tales rests in whether identity and meaning germinate from progressive linear changes or progress or from a continuous return to primitive realities of war, death, and the competition for survival.The discussion of political implications ranges among writers from H. G. Wells, Robert A. Heinlein, Ursula Le Guin, and Isaac Asimov to more radical recent voices such as Iain M. Banks, William Gibson, Joanna Russ, Philip K. Dick, and China Mieville. While emphasizing the literature, the collection also addresses political science fiction found on film and television from the original """"Star Trek"""" through the newest incarnation of """"Battlestar Galactica"""".",Literary Criticism,en,382.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-8iD6iuO-iAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2008.0,complete

lALGYRHmqycC,A Geography of Victorian Gothic Fiction,Robert Mighall,OUP Oxford,2003,"This is the first major full-length study of Victorian Gothic fiction. Combining original readings of familiar texts with a rich store of historical sources, A Geography of Victorian Gothic Fiction is an historicist survey of nineteenth-century Gothic writing--from Dickens to Stoker, Wilkie Collins to Conan Doyle, through European travelogues, sexological textbooks, ecclesiastic histories and pamphlets on the perils of self-abuse. Critics have thus far tended to concentrate on specific angles of Gothic writing (gender or race), or the belief that the Gothic 'returned' at the so-called fin de si cle. Robert Mighall, by contrast, demonstrates how the Gothic mode was active throughout the Victorian period, and provides historical explanations for its development from late eighteenth century, through the 'Urban Gothic' fictions of the mid-Victorian period, the 'Suburban Gothic' of the Sensation vogue, through to the somatic horrors of Stevenson, Machen, Stoker, and Doyle at the century's close. Mighall challenges the psychological approach to Gothic fiction which currently prevails, demonstrating the importance of geographical, historical, and discursive factors that have been largely neglected by critics, and employing a variety of original sources to demonstrate the contexts of Gothic fiction and explain its development in the Victorian period.",History,en,344.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lALGYRHmqycC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2003.0,complete

BjI4-qex0JgC,The History of the Science-fiction Magazine,"Michael Ashley, Mike Ashley",Liverpool University Press,2000-01-01,"This is the first of three volumes that chart the history of the science fiction magazine from the earliest days to the present. This first volume looks at the exuberant years of the pulp magazines. It traces the growth and development of the science fiction magazines from when Hugo Gernsback launched the very first, Amazing Stories, in 1926 through to the birth of the atomic age and the death of the pulps in the early 1950s. These were the days of the youth of science fiction, when it was brash, raw and exciting: the days of the first great space operas by Edward Elmer Smith and Edmond Hamilton, through the cosmic thought variants by Murray Leinster, Jack Williamson and others to the early 1940s when John W. Campbell at Astounding did his best to nurture the infant genre into adulthood. Under him such major names as Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, A. E. van Vogt and Theodore Sturgeon emerged who, along with other such new talents as Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke, helped create modern science fiction. For over forty years magazines were at the heart of science fiction and this book considers how the magazines, and their publishers, editors and authors influenced the growth and perception of this fascinating genre.",Literary Criticism,en,316.0,5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BjI4-qex0JgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2000.0,complete

EquizXeXb3kC,John Fowles's Fiction and the Poetics of Postmodernism,Mahmoud Salami,Associated University Presse,1992,"Salami presents, for instance, a critique of the self-conscious narrative of the diary form in The Collector, the intertextual relations of the multiplicity of voices, the problems of subjectivity, the reader's position, the politics of seduction, ideology, and history in The Magus and The French Lieutenant's Woman. The book also analyzes the ways in which Fowles uses and abuses the short-story genre, in which enigmas remain enigmatic and the author disappears to leave the characters free to construct their own texts. Salami centers, for example, on A Maggot, which embodies the postmodernist technique of dialogical narrative, the problem of narrativization of history, and the explicitly political critique of both past and present in terms of social and religious dissent. These political questions are also echoed in Fowles's nonfictional book The Aristos, in which he strongly rejects the totalization of narratives and the materialization of society.",Language Arts & Disciplines,en,312.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EquizXeXb3kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,1992.0,complete
NYD5FSeERakC,Desire and Domestic Fiction,Nancy Armstrong,Oxford University Press,1987-05-07,"Desire and Domestic Fictionargues that far from being removed from historical events, novels by writers from Richardson to Woolf were themselves agents of the rise of the middle class. Drawing on texts that range from 18th-century female conduct books and contract theory to modern psychoanalytic case histories and theories of reading, Armstrong shows that the emergence of a particular form of female subjectivity capable of reigning over the household paved the way for the establishment of institutions which today are accepted centers of political power. Neither passive subjects nor embattled rebels, the middle-class women who were authors and subjects of the major tradition of British fiction were among the forgers of a new form of power that worked in, and through, their writing to replace prevailing notions of ""identity"" with a gender-determined subjectivity. She also examines the works of such novelists as Richardson, Jane Austen, and the Bront s to reveal the ways in which these authors rewrite the domestic practices and sexual relations of the past to create the historical context through which modern institutional power would seem not only natural but also humane, and therefore to be desired.",Language Arts & Disciplines,en,318.0,5.0,1.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NYD5FSeERakC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,1987.0,complete

Coping with ideas that are both impossible and realistically constructed is the ultimate contemporary challenge of our technology. The chapters of this book move towards establishing appropriate readings that allow contemporary readers to negotiate unreality, a skill that the end of the millennium is making inevitably necessary. Such strategies have long been the preserve of literary and cultural study, and here a number of well-regarded scholars and some new to the field make their contribution to an area that has become increasingly important in recent years. From Mary Shelley to Philip K. Dick, Iain M. Banks to J.G. Ballard, taking in African-American science fiction, Jurassic Park, and Kurt Vonnegut, and exploring issues of alternative history and ideology, feminism, the holocaust, characterisation, and impossible geography, this collection is an important source-book for all those interested in the literature, culture and philosophy of realistic impossible worlds.",Literary Criticism,en,232.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NznwlEC5jVQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,1996.0,complete

The book is a pioneering work that systematically investigates the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western popular fiction, and traces the root causes leading to the differences. By means of narrative comparison, it explores the conceptual and spiritual correlations and differences between Chinese and Western popular fiction and, by relating them to the root causes of cultural spirit, allows us to gain an insight into the cultural heritage of different nations. The book is structured in line with a cause-and-effect logical sequence and moves from the macroscopic to the microscopic, from history to reality, and from theory to practice. The integration of macro-level theoretical studies and micro-level case studies is both novel and effective.

HlWTGIGF-28C,The Reality - Fiction Opposition in Children's Literature,Adrian Zagler,GRIN Verlag,2011,"Bachelor Thesis from the year 2010 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 1, University of Graz, language: English, abstract: Since the 1970s, scholarly interest in children's literature has grown, and numerous studies looking into the complexity and thematic and structural depth of the texts have been published. Simultaneously, the notion of metareferentiality has sparked interest among scholars from various disciplines. Metareferentiality, though not unique to the twentieth and the twenty-first centuries, is said to be one of the key cultural phenomena of our time. And yet, these two fields of interest, namely children's literature and metareferentiality, have only very rarely been studied in the same context. Metareferential elements in children's books are often seen as phenomena of dream worlds. Thus, they allow a traditional, non-critical reading in which the metareferential elements do not necessarily trigger medial awareness in the readers but can be explained logically and within the framework of the represented story worlds. Consequently, the epistemological status of reality would not be threatened by these texts. However, as this paper aims to prove, such a reading (for instance) of the Alice-stories, Die Unendliche Geschichte and The Book of Lost Things, although undeniably possible, falls short of the true scope of the texts. As will be shown, all four books address the question of the status of fiction with reference to its opposition to reality, albeit in different ways. In their treatment of the subject, they are clearly metafictional texts with epistemological and ontological concerns that require experienced readers to fully grasp their messages. Nevertheless, they are still publicly perceived as children's literature and are enjoyed by children and adults alike. After some general remarks on the genre of children's literature and on metareferentiality, this paper focuses on a particular form of metarefere",Language Arts & Disciplines,en,81.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HlWTGIGF-28C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2011.0,complete
TOPDLotW6oAC,"Science Fiction Analysis: Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""",Michael Kratky,GRIN Verlag,2007,"Seminar paper from the year 2006 in the subject American Studies - Literature, grade: 1,00, Catholic University Eichstätt-Ingolstadt (Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaftliche Fakultät), course: Novel and Film, 10 entries in the bibliography, language: English, abstract: ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" is one out of at least six novels by Philip K. Dick that deal substantially with the questions surrounding androids. It is exactly the distortion between the real as the jumping-off point cited above and the hypothetical, unreal, fictional which creates a critical comment on the world the present reader lives in. The special focus on humanlike androids in ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" implies a particular philosophical issue. Of course, the somewhat murky, obscure and intransparent depiction of androids involves the problem of man-machine relationships, which can to a certain extend be equated with human-android relationships. But Dick goes a step further, pointing out the differences as well as the parallels between both the android and the human being, using ambiguous descriptions and playing with the reader's sympathy for both sides. One could even argue that Dick tried to create a kind of meeting halfway between man and android. Certainly, Dick himself faces difficulties when trying to define the android as ""a thing somehow generated to deceive us in a cruel way, to cause us to think it to be one of ourselves."" This description meets exactly to core of our analysis, which deals with the impact and the effects created by this somewhat ambiguous representation of human and android life.",Biography & Autobiography,en,25.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TOPDLotW6oAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2007.0,complete

32ySDAAAQBAJ,"Love and Sexuality in Dystopian Fiction. An Analysis of ""Brave New World"" and ""Nineteen Eighty-Four""",Lena Gräf,GRIN Verlag,2016-04-26,"Seminar paper from the year 2015 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 2,3, , language: English, abstract: This term paper is supposed to deal with how love and sex are depicted in Brave New World and 1984, and if there are any similarities between them. Furthermore we will take a brief look at differences and similarities to love and sex in our society. What is the attitude towards marriage these days? And what is the role of love in all of that? After this we will then hopefully be able to identify what love and sex in dystopian fiction means. Ever since Thomas Mores Utopia love and sex have been a part of dystopian novels. In Thomas Mores times his depictions were ground breaking. Women were not allowed to marry until they were 18. In the past this was highly unusual, since most women married at the age of around 14. Furthermore divorce is forbidden, which, at this point, mirrors the time More lived in. This clearly influenced all the following writers of dystopian novels. They imagine a world that is negatively silhouetted against their own world. And since love is a big part of every society it is also a big part in every dystopian society. When looking for the most famous dystopian novels on Google, two that are immediately suggested are ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley and ""1984"" by George Orwell. Both have one thing in common: their rather negative and, for us, rather unusual attitude towards love, relationships and sex.",Literary Criticism,en,24.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=32ySDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2016.0,complete

6t58GSNWSnQC,The Postsouthern Sense of Place in Contemporary Fiction,Martyn Bone,LSU Press,2005-06-01,"For generations, southern novelists and critics have grappled with a concept that is widely seen as a trademark of their literature: a strong attachment to geography, or a ""sense of place."" In the 1930s, the Agrarians accorded special meaning to rural life, particularly the farm, in their definitions of southern identity. For them, the South seemed an organic and rooted region in contrast to the North, where real estate development and urban sprawl evoked a faceless, raw capitalism. By the end of the twentieth century, however, economic and social forces had converged to create a modernized South. How have writers responded to this phenomenon? Is there still a sense of place in the South, or perhaps a distinctly postsouthern sense of place? Martyn Bone innovatively draws upon postmodern thinking to consider the various perspectives that southern writers have brought to the concept of ""place"" and to look at its fate in a national and global context. He begins with a revisionist assessment of the Agrarians, who failed in their attempts to turn their proprietary ideal of the small farm into actual policy but whose broader rural aesthetic lived on in the work of neo-Agrarian writers, including William Faulkner and Eudora Welty. By the 1950s, adherence to this aesthetic was causing southern writers and critics to lose sight of the social reality of a changing South. Bone turns to more recent works that do respond to the impact of capitalist spatial development on the South -- and on the nation generally -- including that self-declared ""international city"" Atlanta. Close readings of novels by Robert Penn Warren, Walker Percy, Richard Ford, Anne Rivers Siddons, Tom Wolfe, and Toni Cade Bambara illuminate evolving ideas about capital, land, labor, and class while introducing southern literary studies into wider debates around social, cultural, and literary geography. Bone concludes his remarkably rich book by considering works of Harry Crews and Barbara Kingsolver that suggest the southern sense of place may be not only post-Agrarian or postsouthern but also transnational.",Literary Criticism,en,300.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6t58GSNWSnQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2005.0,complete

Wesley,Praeger,1993-05-18,"This comprehensive and sophisticated feminist analysis contradicts the negative evaluations of earlier feminist critics to define Oates' feminist accomplishments. Wesley presents Oates' fiction as a dynamic structure that grew out of her obsessive concern with the American family and shows her literary patterns of resistance to the gender ideology that shapes it. She illustrates how Oates' disturbing portrayals of troubled families can and do address complex issues of power in contemporary society--economic dislocation, gender inequity, and violence--as they are experienced in intimate relationships. The author defines and exemplifies the central concepts of family, power, and resistance in Oates' work with reference to her own literary criticism and the theoretical principles of Frederic Jameson. She begins by examining the presentation of the mother and the father in Oates' earliest works and then charts mother and daughter, brother and sister, and other family relationships. Wesley contends that the power dynamics of Oates' families relegate daughters to a position of impotence and sons to one of isolation and shows that the evolution of the children's refusal to identify themselves with their male or female models is a major focus in Oates' fiction.",Literary Criticism,en,200.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mx9bAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,1993.0,complete

Young Ruby Bell, ""the kind of pretty it hurt to look at,"" has suffered beyond imagining, so as soon as she can, she flees suffocating Liberty for the bright pull of 1950s New York. Ruby quickly winds her way into the ripe center of the city-the darkened piano bars and hidden alleyways of the Village-all the while hoping for a glimpse of the red hair and green eyes of her mother. When a telegram from her cousin forces her to return home, thirty-year-old Ruby finds herself reliving the devastating violence of her girlhood. With the terrifying realization that she might not be strong enough to fight her way back out again, Ruby struggles to survive her memories of the town's dark past. Meanwhile, Ephram must choose between loyalty to the sister who raised him and the chance for a life with the woman he has loved since he was a boy. Full of life, exquisitely written, and suffused with the pastoral beauty of the rural South, Ruby is a transcendent novel of passion and courage. This wondrous page-turner rushes through the red dust and gossip of Main Street, to the pit fire where men swill bootleg outside Bloom's Juke, to Celia Jennings's kitchen, where a cake is being made, yolk by yolk, that Ephram will use to try to begin again with Ruby. Utterly transfixing, with unforgettable characters, riveting suspense, and breathtaking, luminous prose, Ruby offers an unflinching portrait of man's dark acts and the promise of the redemptive power of love.",Fiction,en,276.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OVHoBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2015.0,complete

For one industrious young man in Savannah, though, it's not changing fast enough. Oliver Court has an idea that just might expedite the process, but can he put that idea into practice before someone catches up to him? Oliver won't be alone in his quest, as long as he can convince his friends to help him. The closest of those friends, however, is not exactly thrilled by Ollie's recent decision to offer himself up as a disobedient sacrifice. Meanwhile, Trigg Johnson and Jarvis Allen have a conundrum of their own to ponder. They've recently become Savannah's most infamous thieves, and the police are not the only ones searching for them. Some of the most vicious criminals in the Coastal Empire want to find them first. Is there a crossroads for these factions? Can any of them find freedom? Tyrel Kane is a self-described American gypsy, a six-year Sailor who was born into a military family with roots spread across the Nation and the World. Formally trained as a chef, a golf professional, a writer, and an imbiber of fine alcohols, Tyrel's studies and adventures have taken him to sixteen countries on three continents.

IVD0jwEACAAJ,The Pearl of Lima,"Jules Verne, Anne T. Wilbur",Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2015-11-28,"Jules Gabriel Verne (1828 -1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright best known for his adventure novels and his profound influence on the literary genre of science fiction. Verne was born to bourgeois parents in the seaport of Nantes, where he was trained to follow in his father's footsteps as a lawyer, but quit the profession early in life to write for magazines and the stage. His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the Voyages Extraordinaires, a widely popular series of scrupulously researched adventure novels including Journey to the Center of the Earth, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Verne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism. The pioneering submarine designer Simon Lake credited his inspiration to Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and his autobiography begins ""Jules Verne was in a sense the director-general of my life."" William Beebe, Sir Ernest Shackleton, and Robert Ballard found similar early inspiration in the novel, and Jacques Cousteau called it his ""shipboard bible."" The aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont named Verne as his favorite author and the inspiration for his own elaborate flying machines. Igor Sikorsky often quoted Verne and cited his Robur the Conqueror as the inspiration for his invention of the first successful helicopter. The rocketry innovators Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert Goddard, and Hermann Oberth are all known to have taken their inspiration from Verne's From the Earth to the Moon. Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and William Anders, the astronauts on the Apollo 8 mission, were similarly inspired, with Borman commenting ""In a very real sense, Jules Verne is one of the pioneers of the space age."" When cosmonaut Georgi Grechko was orbiting Earth with Yuri Romanenko on the Salyut 6 in 1978, he broadcast back a message to celebrate Verne's 150th birthday, saying: ""There's hardly a person who hasn't read his books, at any rate not among the cosmonauts, because Jules Verne was a dreamer, a visionary who saw flights in space.

ggpgAAAAMAAJ,Generations of Winter,Василий Аксенов,Random House (NY),1994,"""Written in the great tradition of epic Russian fiction, Generations of Winter is a magnificent saga that captures one of the most fascinating chapters in modern history - the Soviet Union in the years 1925 to 1945. Breathtaking in its scope, masterful in its command of historical events and its understanding of timeless human truths, the novel has been likened to a twentieth-century War and Peace, and it marks a bold and brilliant departure for celebrated Russian author Vassily Aksyonov."" ""At the center of this vast panoramic work is the genteel Gradov family. Patriarch Boris is an esteemed surgeon, his wife, Mary, a pianist, has two great passions - her family and the music of Chopin. Their elder son, Nikita, is a dashing officer in the Red Army, their younger son, Kirill, is a philosopher and devout Marxist, and their daughter, Nina, is a free-spirited poet with a dangerous tendency to speak her mind. Propelled by their loves, ambitions, and beliefs, the Gradovs cross paths with such historical figures as Joseph Stalin and head of the secret police Lavrenty Beria, who are brought unforgettably to life in these pages. As Stalin's power grows in the 1930s, the Soviet Union is plunged into a period of unprecedented intrigue, paranoia, and oppression, and the Gradovs suffer their share of tragedy. When the nation is caught up in the tidal wave of the Second World War, we follow the family through episodes of heroism and betrayal, victory and loss, on the battlefield and the home front alike.""

Essays by nineteen distinguished scholars provide critical insights into the significant genres, historical contexts, cultural diversity and major authors during a period of enormous American global political and cultural power. This power is overshadowed, nevertheless, by national anxieties growing out of events ranging from the Civil Rights Movement to the rise of feminism; from the Cold War and its fear of Communism and nuclear warfare to the Age of Terror and its different yet related fears of the 'Other'. American fiction since 1945 has faithfully chronicled these anxieties.

Literary critics have examined many themes in the novel, such as the role of women in Victorian culture, conventional and conservative sexuality, immigration, colonialism, postcolonialism and folklore.

rrOeg3_HdYwC,A Ready-Made Life,Chong-un Kim,University of Hawaii Press,1998-07-01,"A Ready Made Life is the first volume of early modern Korean fiction to appear in English in the U.S. Written between 1921 and 1943, the sixteen stories are an excellent introduction to the riches of modern Korean fiction. They reveal a variety of settings, voices, styles, and thematic concerns, and the best of them, masterpieces written mainly in the mid-1930s, display an impressive artistic maturity. Included among these authors are Hwang Sun-won, modern Korea's greatest short story writer; Kim Tong-in, regarded by many as the author who best captures the essence of the Korean identity; Ch'ae Man-shik, a master of irony; Yi Sang, a prominent modernist; Kim Yu-jong, whose stories are marked by a unique blend of earthy humor and compassion; Yi Kwang-su and Kim Tong-ni, modernizers of the language of twentieth-century Korean fiction; and Yi Ki-yúng, Yi T'ae-jun, and Pak T'ae-won, three writers who migrated to North Korea shortly after Liberation in 1945 and whose works were subsequently banned in South Korea until democratization in the late 1980s. One way of reading the stories, all of which were written during the Japanese occupation, is that beneath their often oppressive and gloomy surface lies an anticolonial subtext. They can also be read as a collective record of a people whose life choices were severely restricted, not just by colonization, but by education (either too little or too much, as the title story shows) and by a highly structured society that had little tolerance for those who overstepped its boundaries. Life was unremittingly onerous for many Koreans during this period, whatever their social background. In the stories, educated city folk fare little better than farmers and laborers. A Ready-Made Life will provide scholars and students with crucial access to the literature of Korea's colonial period. A generous opening essay discusses the collection in the context of modern Korean literary history, and short introductions precede each story.

In 1943, when the United States learns that Germany is on the verge of a deadly innovation that could tip the balance of the war, the government turns to an unlikely source for help: the nations top science fiction writers. Installed at a covert military lab within the Philadelphia Naval Yard are the most brilliant of these young visionaries. The unruly band is led by Robert Heinlein, the dashing and complicated master of the genre. His Kamikaze Group, which includes the ambitious genius Isaac Asimov, is tasked with transforming the wonders of science fiction into science fact and unlocking the secrets to invisibility, death rays, force fields, weather control, and other astounding phenomenaand finding it harder than they ever imagined. When a German spy washes ashore near the abandoned Long Island ruins of a mysterious energy facility, the military begins to fear that the Nazis are a step ahead of Heinleins group. Now the oddball team, joined by old friends from the Pulp Era including L. Ron Hubbard (court-martialed for attacking Mexico), must race to catch up. The answers they seek may be locked in the legendary War of Currents, which was fought decades earlier between Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. As the threat of an imminent Nazi invasion of America grows more and more possible, events are set in motion that just may revolutionize the futureor destroy itwhile forcing the writers to challenge the limits of talent, imagination, love, destiny, and even reality itself. Blazing at breathtaking speed from forgotten tunnels deep beneath Manhattan to top-secret battles in the North Pacific, and careening from truth to pulp and back again, The Astounding, the Amazing, and the Unknown is a sweeping, romantic epica page-turning rocket ship ride through the history of the future.",Fiction,en,434.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=43ipZ4yXUY8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2011.0,complete

8oMcEAAAQBAJ,Unless the Threat of Death is Behind Them,John T. Irwin,JHU Press,2006-10-25,"The noted literary critic delves into the psychology and significance of American hardboiled crime fiction and film noir of the 1930s and 40s. Early in the twentieth century, American crime novelists like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler put forward a new kind of character: the hard-boiled detective, as exemplified by Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon. Unlike the analytical detectives of nineteenth-century fiction, these new detectives encountered cases not as intricate logical puzzles but as stark challenges of manhood. John T. Irwin explores how the stories of these characters grapple with ideas of American masculinity. Professional codes are pitted against personal desires, resulting in either ruinous relationships or solitary integrity. In thematic conflicts between independence and subordination, all notions of manly independence prove subordinate to the hand of fate. Tracing the stylistic development of the genre, Irwin demonstrates the particular influence of the novel of manners, especially the writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald. He also shows that as hard-boiled fiction began to appear on the screen in film noir, it took on themes of female empowermentjust as women entered the workforce in large numbers. Finally, he discusses how these themes persist in contemporary dramatic series on television, representing the conflicted lives of Americans into the twenty-first century.",Literary Criticism,en,445.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8oMcEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2006.0,complete

The authorities think the terrorist attack and the death of Tarent's wife are somehow connected. A century earlier, a stage magician is sent to the Western Front on a secret mission to render British reconnaissance aircraft invisible to the enemy. On his journey to the trenches he meets the visionary who believes that this will be the war to end all wars. In 1943, a woman pilot from Poland tells a young RAF technician of her escape from the Nazis, and her desperate need to return home. In the present day, a theoretical physicist stands in his English garden and creates the first adjacency. THE ADJACENT is a novel where nothing is quite as it seems. Where fiction and history intersect, where every version of reality is suspect, where truth and falsehood lie closely adjacent to one another.

xzH2G-8hIQwC,RUBURY:NOVELTY OF NEWSPAPERS P,Matthew Rubery,"Oxford University Press, USA",2009-06-01,"Rapid industrialization and new advances in technology marked the Victorian period as one of prodigious socio-cultural change. Chief among the many transformations of quotidian life was the swift and widespread dissemination of information made possible by the emergence of the daily newspaper, an unprecedented new media. The changes it wrought in politics, history, and advertising of the age have all been well-documented. But its influence on one area remains overlooked: the Victorian novel. Redressing this oversight, The Novelty of Newspapers highlights the variety of ways the changing world of nineteenth-century journalism shaped the period's most popular literary form. Arising in the 1800s and soon drawing a million readers a day, the commercial press profoundly influenced the work of Bronte, Braddon, Dickens, Conrad, James, Trollope, and others who mined print journalism for fictional techniques. Five of the most important of these narrative conventions-the shipping intelligence, personal advertisement, leading article, interview, and foreign correspondence-show how the Victorian novel is best understood alongside the simultaneous development of newspapers. In highly original analyses of Victorian fiction, this study also captures the surprising ways in which public media enabled the expression of private feeling among ordinary readers: from the trauma caused by a lover's reported suicide to the vicarious gratification felt during a celebrity interview; from the distress at finding one's behavior the subject of unflattering editorial commentary to the apprehension of distant cultures through the foreign correspondence. Combining a wealth of historical research with a series of astute close readings, The Novelty of Newspapers breaks down the assumed divide between the epoch's literature and journalism and demonstrates that newsprint was integral to the development of the novel.",Language Arts & Disciplines,en,245.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xzH2G-8hIQwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2009.0,complete

Although less popular than The Wind in the Willows (1908), which would go on to become not only a defining work of Edwardian English literature, but one of the most popular works of childrens fiction in the world, The Golden Age is a moving portrait of youth, an understated autobiographical meditation made for children and adults alike. Recalling his youth among elders who exemplified Victorian values of stoicism and quiet decency, Kenneth Grahame refers to these hallowed figures as the Olympians whose presence provided both order and necessary balance to his rambunctious, imaginative boyhood. Now an adult himself, Grahame wonders if he has become one of these Olympians, and looks back on his youth not only for an answer, but for a reaffirmation of the joy and freedom of a childhood spent among friends. In the stories that follow, he recalls the games they played, the places they discovered, and the legends they made of the normal, the boring, and the everyday found all around them. Filled with references to classical Greek mythology, Grahames collection is nostalgic for a world left behind, yet open to reconstituting a reality more wonderful for its common nature. The Golden Age is not just a book about the experience of childhood, but a study of the past that must remain present within us. Grahames book remains, over a century after it was published, a classic work of literature for children and adults alike.

-_WNzgEACAAJ,The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (Annotated),Oscar Wilde,,2021-06-19,"""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" is the only novel Oscar Wilde ever published and it is considered to be his greatest work. Wilde published the first version of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" in 1890 in a magazine called Lippincott's Monthly, and it was not well received. Readers and critics considered it to be incredibly immoral. These days that probably would mean that the book would get a lot of attention, make a lot of money and get made into a movie with those kids from Twilight. But this was at the end of Victorian era, and morality was a bigger deal then, so a book being called 'immoral' meant it wasn't going to be successful. So Wilde decided to write a second version of the book, with a preface and some additional chapters that he thought would address some of the criticism he received and explain his position as a follower of aestheticism, which just means that he thought something beautiful didn't have to serve a larger purpose. It didn't have to be moral or educational or take a political stance; it could just be beauty for beauty's sake. It's also worth noting that he published ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" around the time that he began his relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas, also known as Bosie. Dorian Gray, the title character of the novel, is a decadent dandy of the Victorian era. Concerned with little but appearances, he lives a reckless, nonproductive existence. A crucial event in his life comes when Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton in the studio of Basil Hallward, an artist, who has painted a portrait of the breathtakingly beautiful Dorian, now in his early twenties. Lord Wotton intrigues Dorian with his talk of the New Hedonism and, unbeknownst to Basil, the picture has somehow become enchanted, and it ages in Dorian's place.

Mpx1zgEACAAJ,Orley Farm. By: Anthony Trollope,Anthony Trollope,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2017-02,"Orley Farm is a novel written in the realist mode by Anthony Trollope (1815-82), and illustrated by the Pre-Raphaelite artist John Everett Millais (1829-96). It was first published in monthly shilling parts by the London publisher Chapman and Hall. Although this novel appeared to have undersold (possibly because the shilling part was being overshadowed by magazines, such as The Cornhill, that offered a variety of stories and poems in each issue), Orley Farm became Trollope's personal favourite. George Orwell said the book contained ""one of the most brilliant descriptions of a lawsuit in English fiction."" The house in the book was based on a farm in Harrow once owned by the Trollope family. The real-life farm became a school, which was originally supposed to be the feeder school to Harrow School. It was renamed Orley Farm School after the novel, with Trollope's permission. Plot: When Joseph Mason of Groby Park, Yorkshire, died, he left his estate to his family. A codicil to his will, however, left Orley Farm (near London) to his much younger second wife and infant son. The will and the codicil were in her handwriting, and there were three witnesses, one of whom was no longer alive. A bitterly fought court case confirmed the codicil. Twenty years pass. Lady Mason lives at Orley Farm with her adult son, Lucius. Samuel Dockwrath, a tenant, is asked to leave by Lucius, who wants to try new intensive farming methods. Aggrieved, and knowing of the original case (John Kenneby, one of the codicil witnesses, had been an unsuccessful suitor of his wife Miriam Usbech), Dockwrath investigates and finds a second deed signed by the same witnesses on the same date, though they can remember signing only one. He travels to Groby Park in Yorkshire, where Joseph Mason the younger lives with his comically parsimonious wife, and persuades Mason to have Lady Mason prosecuted for forgery. The prosecution fails, but Lady Mason later confesses privately that she committed the forgery, and is prompted by conscience to give up the estate. There are various subplots. The main one deals with a slowly unfolding romance between Felix Graham (a young and relatively poor barrister without family) and Madeline Staveley, daughter of Judge Stavely of Noningsby. Graham has a long-standing engagement to the penniless Mary Snow, whom he supports and educates while she is being ""moulded"" to be his wife. Between the Staveleys at Alston and Orley Farm at Hamworth lies the Cleve, where Sir Peregrine Orme lives with his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Orme, and grandson, Peregrine. Sir Peregrine falls in love with Lady Mason and is briefly engaged to her, but she calls off the match when she realises the seriousness of the court case. Meanwhile, Mr. Furnival, another barrister, befriends Lady Mason, arousing the jealousy of his wife. His daughter, Sophia, has a brief relationship with Augustus Stavely and a brief engagement to Lucius Mason. Eventually Furnival and his wife are reconciled, and Sophia's engagement is dropped. Sophia is portrayed as an intelligent woman who writes comically skilful letters....

Fletcher, one of the most prolific, leading writers of the Golden Age of detective fiction and first published in 1920, the novel still enjoys great popularity among fans of quick-paced stories that involve complicated mysteries and pure-hearted amateur investigators. The narrator of the story is a young man called Hugh Moneylaws, a clerk in the office of a lawyer called Mr. Lindsey in Berwick-Upon-Tweed, a small and quiet town on the border between England and Scotland. Hugh is on an errand that he undertakes from a mysterious lodger in his mother's boarding house in order to supplement his salary when he comes across a dead body - the first in the line of many, the story featuring a high body count. As the investigation goes on, Hugh travels to all sorts of places by train, by ship and other vehicles and gets into all sorts of dangerous situations that he manages to escape miraculously, very often with the help of his employer who is also the brains behind the entire investigation.The mystery is complicated, but also predictable to a certain extent. However, that does not make the novel less enjoyable - the plot comes with beautiful, remote places, closely-knit communities that have their own rules and laws, excellently-penned characters, principal and minor alike, lots of humorous events and adventures that will make the reader laugh out loud and a romantic story line that makes it all even more exciting.",,en,274.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N2M2zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2021.0,incomplete

VN18oAEACAAJ,Holiday Romance,Charles Dickens,CreateSpace,2013-04-22,"Holiday Romance is a short story by Charles Dickens. Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 - 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's most memorable fictional characters and is generally regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian period. During his life, his works enjoyed unprecedented fame, and by the twentieth century his literary genius was broadly acknowledged by critics and scholars. His novels and short stories continue to be widely popular. Born in Portsmouth, England, Dickens was forced to leave school to work in a factory when his father was thrown into debtors' prison. Although he had little formal education, his early impoverishment drove him to succeed. Over his career he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas and hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms. Dickens sprang to fame with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly installments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback. For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens went on to improve the character with positive features.",Literary Collections,en,72.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VN18oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2013.0,complete

IseuzQEACAAJ,The Fall of Rome,Michael Curtis Ford,Thomas Dunne Books,2007-05-15,"476 a.d.: The Roman Empire, riddled with corruption and staggered by centuries of barbarian onslaughts, now faces its greatest challenge---not only to its wealth and prestige, but to its very existence. In his riveting novel The Sword of Attila, Michael Curtis Ford thrilled readers with his recounting of a cataclysmic clash of ancient civilizations. Now, in The Fall of Rome, he takes on the bloody twilight of empire, as the legacy of Attila---once thought destroyed on the battlefield---emerges again to defy the power of the Western World. In this powerful saga of Roman warfare, the sons of Attila's great officers wage battle with one another as the dramatic confrontation between Rome's last emperor and Rome's barbarian conqueror leads to the thrilling dénouement that becomes the fall of a mighty empire. Pulsing with intrigue, saturated with historical detail, The Fall of Rome brings readers to new places--pressed into the trenches as catapult bolts fly overhead, lurking within the palace where betrayal is plotted, imprisoned in a tower stronghold where an emperor turns mad. Once again, Ford demonstrates his mastery as a chronicler of battle, honor, and ancient worlds in this masterfully plotted epic novel that will leave readers begging for more.

3r4gAQAAIAAJ,Margaret Atwood's Power,Shannon Eileen Hengen,Sumach Press,1993,"In this incisive feminist analysis, Hengen provides a psychoanalytic overview examining Atwood's treatment of women and power.

In her novels and poems Atwood's protagonists explore the lives of their mothers and grandmothers in order to reflect on the lives and struggles we confront today. Using the metaphor of narcissism-both progressive and regressive-and the mirror imagery that threads through Atwood's work, Hengen gives a feminist reading to the work of this important Canadian author. Hengen argues that the connections women are able to make between their own lives today and the lives portrayed by Atwood account in part for the writer's wide popularity. An important contribution, Margaret Atwood's Power is a thought-provoking evaluation which provides new insights into Margaret Atwood's work and popularity.",Literary Criticism,en,188.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3r4gAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,1993.0,complete

9ZpsBgAAQBAJ,Science Fact and Science Fiction,Brian Stableford,Routledge,2006-09-06,"Science fiction is a literary genre based on scientific speculation. Works of science fiction use the ideas and the vocabulary of all sciences to create valid narratives that explore the future effects of science on events and human beings. Science Fact and Science Fiction examines in one volume how science has propelled science-fiction and, to a lesser extent, how science fiction has influenced the sciences. Although coverage will discuss the science behind the fiction from the Classical Age to the present, focus is naturally on the 19th century to the present, when the Industrial Revolution and spectacular progress in science and technology triggered an influx of science-fiction works speculating on the future. As scientific developments alter expectations for the future, the literature absorbs, uses, and adapts such contextual visions. The goal of the Encyclopedia is not to present a catalog of sciences and their application in literary fiction, but rather to study the ongoing flow and counterflow of influences, including how fictional representations of science affect how we view its practice and disciplines. Although the main focus is on literature, other forms of science fiction, including film and video games, are explored and, because science is an international matter, works from non-English speaking countries are discussed as needed.",Fiction,en,756.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9ZpsBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2006.0,complete
yk7EEAAAQBAJ,Young Adult Science Fiction,C. W. Sullivan III,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,1999-03-30,"At the close of the nineteenth century, American youths developed a growing interest in electricity and its applications, machines, and gadgetry. When authors and publishers recognized the extent of this interest in technology, they sought to create reading materials that would meet this market need. The result was science fiction written especially for young adults. While critics tended to neglect young adult science fiction for decades, they gradually came to recognize its practical and cultural value. Science fiction inspired many young adults to study science and engineering and helped foster technological innovation. At the same time, these works also explored cultural and social concerns more commonly associated with serious literature. Nor was young adult science fiction a peculiarly American phenomenon: authors in other countries likewise wrote science fiction for young adult readers. This book examines young adult science fiction in the U.S. and several other countries and explores issues central to the genre. The first part of the book treats the larger contexts of young adult science fiction and includes chapters on its history and development. Included are discussions of science fiction for young adults in the U.S. and in Canada, Great Britain, Germany, and Australia. These chapters are written by expert contributors and chart the history of young adult science fiction from the nineteenth century to the present. The second section of the book considers topics of special interest to young adult science fiction. Some of the chapters look at particular forms and expressions of science fiction, such as films and comic books. Others treat particular topics, such as the portrayal of women in Robert Heinlein's works and representations of war in young adult science fiction. Yet another chapter studies the young adult science fiction novel as a coming-of-age story and thus helps distinguish the genre from science fiction written for adult readers. All chapters reflect current research, and the volume concludes with extensive bibliographies.",Literary Criticism,en,260.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yk7EEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,1999.0,complete

CNUiEAAAQBAJ,Ecofeminist Science Fiction,Douglas A. Vakoch,Routledge,2021-04-29,"Ecofeminist Science Fiction: International Perspectives on Gender, Ecology, and Literature provides guidance in navigating some of the most pressing dangers we face today. Science fiction helps us face problems that threaten the very existence of humankind by giving us the emotional distance to see our current situation from afar, separated in our imaginations through time, space, or circumstance. Extrapolating from contemporary science, science fiction allows a critique of modern society, imagining more life-affirming alternatives. In this collection, ecocritics from five continents scrutinize science fiction for insights into the fundamental changes we need to make to survive and thrive as a species. Contributors examine ecofeminist themes in films, such as Avatar, Star Wars, and The Stepford Wives, as well as television series including Doctor Who and Westworld. Other scholars explore an internationally diverse group of both canonical and lesser-known science fiction writers including Oreet Ashery, Iraj Fazel Bakhsheshi, Liu Cixin, Louise Erdrich, Hanns Heinz Ewers, Larissa Lai, Ursula K. Le Guin, Chen Qiufan, Mary Doria Russell, Larissa Sansour, Karen Traviss, and Jeanette Winterson. Ecofeminist Science Fiction explores the origins of human-caused environmental change in the twin oppressions of women and of nature, driven by patriarchal power and ideologies. Female embodiment is examined through diverse natural and artificial forms, and queer ecologies challenge heteronormativity.

This book examines how even the smallest damage caused by human beings to the environment negatively affects them, other living beings, and the ecosystem they need to live and flourish. In conjunction with these, the factors and conditions that push characters in the novels to ignore and harm the environment are also scrutinised.

XAE3DAAAQBAJ,The Subject of Race in American Science Fiction,Sharon DeGraw,Routledge,2006-12-19,"While the connections between science fiction and race have largely been neglected by scholars, racial identity is a key element of the subjectivity constructed in American SF. In his Mars series, Edgar Rice Burroughs primarily supported essentialist constructions of racial identity, but also included a few elements of racial egalitarianism. Writing in the 1930s, George S. Schuyler revised Burroughs' normative SF triangle of white author, white audience, and white protagonist and promoted an individualistic, highly variable concept of race instead. While both Burroughs and Schuyler wrote SF focusing on racial identity, the largely separate genres of science fiction and African American literature prevented the similarities between the two authors from being adequately acknowledged and explored. Beginning in the 1960s, Samuel R. Delany more fully joined SF and African American literature. Delany expands on Schuyler's racial constructionist approach to identity, including gender and sexuality in addition to race. Critically intertwining the genres of SF and African American literature allows a critique of the racism in the science fiction and a more accurate and positive portrayal of the scientific connections in the African American literature. Connecting the popular fiction of Burroughs, the controversial career of Schuyler, and the postmodern texts of Delany illuminates a gradual change from a stable, essentialist construction of racial identity at the turn of the century to the variable, social construction of poststructuralist subjectivity today.",Literary Criticism,en,241.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XAE3DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2006.0,complete

In Science Fiction and Empire, Patricia Kerslake brings contemporary thinking about postcolonialism and imperialism to bear on a variety of classic sci-fi novels and films, including The War of the Worlds, Stanislaw Lems Solaris, and Star Wars. The first book to identify the consequences of empire in science fiction, Kerslakes study is a compelling investigation of the political ramifications of how we imagine our future.

Zao2IFNhvQkC,Bridges to Science Fiction,George Edgar Slusser,,1980,"Ten new critical essays written for presentation at the first Eaton Conference on Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature held 24-25February 1979, at the University of California, Riverside. While critical discussion of science fiction has become increasingly sophisticated during the past decade, there remains a tendency among some teachers and readers to consider science fiction as an independent phenomenon that exists unconnected to the mainstream of our cultural inheritance. These essays--by Harry Levin, Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard University; Kent T. Kraft, Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Georgia, Athens; Stephen Potts, writer and instructor at San Diego State University; Gregory Benford, writer and Associate Professor of Physics at the University of California, Irvine; Robert Hunt, an editor at Glencoe Publishing; Eric S. Rabkin, Professor of English at the University of Michigan; Patrick Parrinder, instructor at the University of Reading, England; Thomas Keeling, Lecturer in English at the University of California, Los Angeles; Carl D. Malmgren, instructor at the University of Oregon, Eugene; and Thomas Hanzo, Professor of English and Chairman of the department at the University of California, Davis--suggest the connections that exist between science fiction and other aspects of Western cultural tradition. Ranging in interest from the specifically philosophical to the specifically literary, the essays relate science fiction to such topics as medieval cosmological discourse, classical empirical philosophy, fairy tale, epic, and Gothic fiction. Emerging from the volume as a whole are both a coherent view of science fiction as a genre and a heightened sense of its complex relation to our cultural heritage.",Literary Collections,en,266.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zao2IFNhvQkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,1980.0,complete

Comparing the science and weapons programs of all the major combatants, he demonstrates that Japan's failure was nearly inevitable, given its paucity of strategic resources, an inadequate industrial base, the absence of effective centralized management to coordinate research, military hostility toward civilian scientists, and bitter interservice rivalries. In the end, Japan could not overcome these obstacles and thus failed to make the transition to the kind of ""Big Science"" it needed to ward off its enemies and dominate the Far East.""--BOOK JACKET.",History,en,368.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fYzfAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2005.0,complete

9msaAQAAIAAJ,Reinventing Richard Nixon,Daniel E. Frick,,2008,"""Examining Nixon's autobiographies and political memorabilia, Frick offers far-reaching perceptions not only of the man but of Nixon's version of himself - contrasted with those who would interpret him differently. He cites reinventions of Nixon from the late 1980s, particularly the museum at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace, to demonstrate the resilience of certain national mythic narratives in the face of liberal critiques. And he recounts how celebrants at Nixon's state funeral, at which Bob Dole's eulogy depicted a God-fearing American hero, attempted to bury the sources of our divisions over him, rendering in some minds the judgment of ""redeemed statesman"" to erase his status as ""disgraced president."""" ""With dozens of illustrations - Nixon posing with Elvis (the National Archives' most requested photo), Nixonian cultural artifacts, classic editorial cartoons - no other book collects in one place such varied images of Nixon from so many diverse media. These reinforce Frick's probing analysis to help us understand why we disagree about Nixon - and why it matters how we resolve our disagreements.""--BOOK JACKET.",Biography & Autobiography,en,352.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9msaAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2008.0,complete

The compendium is a sampling of the abundance and variety of collections available for use. Special collections have been broadly construed to encompass distinctive, rare and unique, emerging media, born-digital, digitized, uncommon, non-standard, primary, and heritage materials. Celebrating Research includes 118 collection profiles, each from a different ARL member library. Each profile is illustrated with color photographs and tells a story of a single collection, recounting how the resources were acquired and developed. The compilation is rich with examples of how research libraries are engaging different communities to deliver library services and encourage the use of such distinctive collections. Also included is an introductory essay by British rare book expert Nicolas Barker and an appendix that provides a broad description of each library's special collection holdings and pertinent contact information. The book contains a detailed index; the Web site provides a search engine. The volume is the result of a collaborative effort among ARL member libraries on the occasion of the Association's 75th anniversary. It was edited by Philip N. Cronenwett, Special Collections Librarian Emeritus, Dartmouth College Library; Kevin Osborn, Research  Design Ltd.; and Samuel A.

IHR38MyRyw0C,New Dreams for Old,Mike Resnick,Pyr,2006-06-01,"New Dreams for Old is a collection of science fiction and fantasy stories by Mike Resnick, showing the depth and range that has not only made him a popular seller, but also placed him fourth (and climbing) on the all-time award list of all science fiction writers living and dead (as compiled by Locus). This book contains award winners and nominees. It contains two stories that are currently in development by Hollywood. It contains stories that have won readers polls, that have won foreign prizes, and a few that are just out-and-out hilarious. Most of these stories constitute recent work. One of them  ""Travels With My Cats""  was a 2005 Hugo Award-winner and a Nebula nominee, while another  ""A Princess of Earth""  was also a 2005 Hugo nominee. The story ""Robots Don't Cry"" was a 2004 Hugo nominee the previous year. Also included are the Hugo and Nebula nominee ""For I Have Touched the Sky,"" Hugo nominee ""Mwalimu in the Squared Circle,"" and Hugo winner ""The 43 Antarean Dynasties."" This collection also includes two novellas that have never seen print outside of the members-only Science Fiction Book Club. Are there really elephants on Neptune? What does Old MacDonald of nursery-rhyme fame actually grow on his farm? Is there much difference between pruning elderly flowers and elderly people? A trio of award nominees, ""The Elephants on Neptune,"" ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm,"" and ""Hothouse Flowers,"" provide the answers. This is a collection of enormous range and the highest quality. More to the point, every story will not only make the reader think, but feel. The collection is introduced by Nancy Kress, herself a multiple Hugo and Nebula winner, and a monthly columnist for Writer's Digest.",Fiction,en,424.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IHR38MyRyw0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2006.0,complete

7XwVAQAAIAAJ,The Great American Paperback,Richard A. Lupoff,,2001,"""Few realized in 1938 that a revolution was about to take place. A little book appeared in drugstores and on newsstands that would fit into the typical pocket. There was no real binding, no dust jacket; just a colorful, laminated cover....by summer of 1939 everybody was buying and reading them. Regarded by many as disposable distractions, a few people put them aside and started collections that we realize are a valuable and collectible archive of American culture. From the glittering images of square-jawed cowboys to the gritty slum-dwellers of social realism, The Great American Paperback is a bountiful museum of over 600 brilliant covers, each of them a miniature gem evocative of the fashions and attitudes of its era.""--book jacket.",Art,en,328.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7XwVAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2001.0,complete

obWREAAAQBAJ,The Stuff of Science Fiction,Gary Westfahl,McFarland,2022-09-27,"While students and general readers typically cannot relate to esoteric definitions of science fiction, they readily understand the genre as a literature that characteristically deals with subjects such as new inventions, space, robot and aliens. This book looks at science fiction in precisely this manner, with twenty-one chapters that each deal with a subject that is repeatedly addressed in science fiction of recent centuries. Based on a packet of original essays that the author assembled for his classes, the book could serve as a supplemental textbook in science fiction classes, but also contains material of interest to science fiction scholars and others devoted to the genre. In some cases, chapters offer thorough surveys of numerous works involving certain subjects, such as imagined vehicles, journeys beneath the Earth and undersea adventures, discovering intriguing patterns in the ways that various writers developed their ideas. When comprehensive coverage of ubiquitous topics such as robots, aliens and the planet Mars is impossible, chapters focus on major themes referencing selected texts. A conclusion discusses other science fiction subjects that were omitted for various reasons, and a bibliography lists additional resources for the study of science fiction in general and the topics of each chapter.",Literary Criticism,en,298.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=obWREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2022.0,complete

In the sixty years since, science fiction has become a recognized and established literary genre with a significant and growing body of scholarship. The Cambridge History of Science Fiction is a landmark volume as the first authoritative history of the genre. Over forty contributors with diverse and complementary specialties present a history of science fiction across national and genre boundaries, and trace its intellectual and creative roots in the philosophical and fantastic narratives of the ancient past. Science fiction as a literary genre is the central focus of the volume, but fundamental to its story is its non-literary cultural manifestations and influence. Coverage thus includes transmedia manifestations as an integral part of the genre's history, including not only short stories and novels, but also film, art, architecture, music, comics, and interactive media.--",Science fiction,en,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AiP1zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2018.0,complete

G6lHXQWOx6sC,A Distant Technology,J. P. Telotte,Wesleyan University Press,1999,"Science fiction films celebrate and critique the impact of a burgeoning technology on the world's cultural, political, and social milieu. The Machine Age, roughly delineated by the two decades between World Wars, was a watershed period during which modern society entered into an ambiguous embrace with technology that continues today. J. P. Telotte carefully blends film, technology, cultural, and genre studies to illuminate this nearly forgotten era in our cinematic history and to show, through analysis of classics like The Invisible Ray, Metropolis, and Things to Come, how technology played a major role as motif, ""actor,"" and producer. What he also discovers as he ranges among the American, British, Russian, French, and German science fiction cinema  as well as mainstream films, figures, and cultural products such as the New York World's Fair  is a fundamental ambivalence, embedded in the films themselves, about the very machine-age ethos they promoted. Even as advances in the technical apparatus of filmmaking elevated it from mere entertainment to a medium of general communication and genuine artistic expression, Machine Age science fiction films remained curiously distant from and often skeptical of the very machines on which their narratives focus. The resulting tensions, Telotte writes, ""thus seem to intersect with those implicit in a Western world that was struggling with its own transition into the modern,"" rendering the films' task inevitably paradoxical and difficult",Fiction,en,236.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G6lHXQWOx6sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,1999.0,complete

PsLiEAAAQBAJ,The War of The Worlds - A Science Fiction Classic (Complete Edition),H. G. Wells,DigiCat,2023-12-05,"In ""The War of The Worlds,"" H. G. Wells crafts a groundbreaking narrative that explores the dire consequences of humanity's technological advancements through the lens of science fiction. Written in 1898, this novel combines rich, elaborate prose with a gripping plot, depicting the invasion of Earth by Martians armed with advanced weaponry. It not only reflects the anxieties of the Victorian era regarding imperialism and the fear of the unknown but also delves into themes of survival, human resilience, and the ethical implications of scientific progress, setting a precedent for future dystopian literature. H. G. Wells, often hailed as the father of science fiction, drew inspiration from his experiences and the sociopolitical milieu of his time, marked by rapid industrialization and exploration. His background in biology and keen interest in social reform informed his speculative vision, uniquely merging science and storytelling. Wells's critical engagement with contemporary societal issues, including class struggle and the moral responsibilities tied to scientific advancement, permeates this work and underscores his belief in humanity's capacity for both destruction and redemption. ""The War of The Worlds"" is not merely a thrilling tale of invasion; it serves as a profound commentary on human nature. Readers seeking to explore the complexities of civilization, the potential devastation wrought by unchecked progress, and the ultimate question of human survival will find this complete edition a compelling and thought-provoking journey. Wells's foresight into the ramifications of technological advancement resonates with contemporary audiences, making this classic essential reading for lovers of science fiction and critical thought alike.",Fiction,en,202.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PsLiEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2023.0,complete

6k4IEAAAQBAJ,The Golden Age of Science Fiction,John Wade,Pen and Sword,2020-11-12,"A detailed look at the British world of science fiction in the 1950s. John Wade grew up in the 1950s, a decade that has since been dubbed the ""golden age of science fiction."" It was a wonderful decade for the genre, but not so great for young fans. With early television broadcasts being advertised for the first time as ""unsuitable for children"" and the inescapable barrier of the ""X"" certificate in the cinema barring anyone under the age of sixteen, the author had only the radio to fall back onand that turned out to be more fertile for the budding SF fan than might otherwise have been thought. Which is probably why, as he grew older, rediscovering those old TV broadcasts and films that had been out of bounds when he was a kid took on a lure that soon became an obsession. For him, the super-accuracy and amazing technical quality of today's science fiction films pale into insignificance beside the radio, early TV and B-picture films about people who built rockets in their back gardens and flew them to lost planets, or tales of aliens who wanted to take over, if not our entire world, then at least our bodies. This book is a personal account of John Wade's fascination with the genre across all the entertainment media in which it appearedthe sort of stuff he reveled in as a young boyand still enjoys today.

c6B5swEACAAJ,Science Fiction and the Moral Imagination,Russell Blackford,Springer,2017-09-14,"In this highly original book, Russell Blackford discusses the intersection of science fiction and humanitys moral imagination. With the rise of science and technology in the 19th century, and our continually improving understanding of the cosmos, writers and thinkers soon began to imagine futures greatly different from the present. Science fiction was born out of the realization that future technoscientific advances could dramatically change the world. Along with the developments described in modern science fiction - space societies, conscious machines, and upgraded human bodies, to name but a few - come a new set of ethical challenges and new forms of ethics. Blackford identifies these issues and their reflection in science fiction. His fascinating book will appeal to anyone with an interest in philosophy or science fiction, or in how they interact. This is a seasoned, balanced analysis of a major issue in our thinking about the future, seen through the lens of science fiction, a central art of our time. Everyone from humanists to technologists should study these ideas and examples. Blackfords book is wise and savvy, and a delight to read as well.

2O0QDQAAQBAJ,Pseudoscience and Science Fiction,Andrew May,Springer,2016-09-13,"Aliens, flying saucers, ESP, the Bermuda Triangle, antigravity ... are we talking about science fiction or pseudoscience? Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference. Both pseudoscience and science fiction (SF) are creative endeavours that have little in common with academic science, beyond the superficial trappings of jargon and subject matter. The most obvious difference between the two is that pseudoscience is presented as fact, not fiction. Yet like SF, and unlike real science, pseudoscience is driven by a desire to please an audience  in this case, people who want to believe. This has led to significant cross-fertilization between the two disciplines. SF authors often draw on real pseudoscientific theories to add verisimilitude to their stories, while on other occasions pseudoscience takes its cue from SF  the symbiotic relationship between ufology and Hollywood being a prime example of this. This engagingly written, well researched and richly illustrated text explores a wide range of intriguing similarities and differences between pseudoscience and the fictional science found in SF. Andrew May has a degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge University and a PhD in astrophysics from Manchester University. After many years in academia and the private sector, he now works as a freelance writer and scientific consultant. He has written pocket biographies of Newton and Einstein, as well as contributing to a number of popular science books. He has a lifelong interest in science fiction, and has had several articles published in Fortean Times magazine",Science,en,188.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2O0QDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2016.0,complete

7COT9RKz6mAC,Chasing Mystery,Carey Walsh,Liturgical Press,2012-11-01,"Why does God have to be so exasperatingly silent? Why can't we see him at least long enough to allay doubt? How does one grow deeper in love with God against the cultural currents of disdain and antagonism? Chasing Mystery is an exploration into how the Bible negotiates the presence and absence of God in the hopes of forging a path in situations where absences often seem more pressing than presences. Amid the prevailing skepticism and restlessness, says Walsh, we must relearn the skill of trust in reading Scripture. The aim is to experience God through holy writing. Walsh offers a work in biblical theology that explores the liveliness of the God of the Bible. She insists that the pages of the Bible do not simply describe divine presence; they evoke it in the process of reading. Not all the time, certainly not predictably, but enough to warrant a trust. Her goal is to strengthen the heart's reading competency in order to facilitate our encounter with God.",Religion,en,177.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7COT9RKz6mAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2012.0,complete

They consider human sexuality and marriage from a distinctly theological rather than polemical standpoint, aiming to avoid frequently polarized debates. The interesting commonality indicated in the articles is that sex and marriage are not about self-fulfillment, but are outwardly directed, aimed toward the other person, toward growth, maturity, and deepened spirituality, for the benefit of the church, for productive good, and for children. The first section explores theological and ethical issues surrounding human sexuality and aims toward understanding the nature of relationships in these contexts. The second section explores the spiritual nature of marriage and the history of thinking on marriage and family within Christian theology.

a3ufEAAAQBAJ,Eudora Welty and Mystery,"Jacob Agner, Harriet Pollack",Univ. Press of Mississippi,2022-12-28,"Contributions by Jacob Agner, Sarah Gilbreath Ford, Katie Berry Frye, Michael Kreyling, Andrew B. Leiter, Rebecca Mark, Suzanne Marrs, Tom Nolan, Michael Pickard, Harriet Pollack, and Victoria Richard Eudora Weltys ingenious play with readers expectations made her a cunning writer, a paramount modernist, a short story artist of the first rank, and a remarkable literary innovator. In her signature puzzle-texts, she habitually engages with familiar genres and then delights readers with her transformations and nonfulfillment of conventions. Eudora Welty and Mystery: Hidden in Plain Sight reveals how often that play is with mystery, crime, and detective fiction genres, popular fiction forms often condescended to in literary studies, but unabashedly beloved by Welty throughout her lifetime. Put another way, Welty often creates her stories secrets by both evoking and displacing crime fiction conventions. Instead of restoring order with a culminating reveal, her story-puzzles characteristically allow mystery to linger and thicken. The mystery pursued becomes mystery elsewhere. The essays in this collection shift attention from narratives, characters, and plots as they have previously been understood by unearthing enigmas hidden within those constructions. Some of these new readings continue Weltys investigation of hegemonic whiteness and southern narratives of raceoutlining these in chalk as outright crime stories. Other essays show how Welty anticipated the regendering of the form now so characteristic of contemporary women mystery writers. Her tender and widely ranging personal correspondence with the hard-boiled American crime writer Ross Macdonald is also discussed. Together these essays make the case that across her career, Eudora Welty was arguably one of the genres greatest double agents, and, to apply the titles of Macdonalds novels to her inventiveness with the form, she is its underground woman, its unexpected sleeping beauty.",Literary Criticism,en,165.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a3ufEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2022.0,complete

Shu7DwAAQBAJ,The Mystery of Musical Creativity,Hermann Beckh,Temple Lodge Publishing,2019-11-06,"Beckh ventures into provinces that I have not had the opportunity of investigating myself  Rudolf Steiner Lost for decades, the manuscript of Hermann Beckhs final lectures on the subject of music present fundamentally new insights into its cosmic origins. Beckh characterises the qualities of musical development, examines select musical works (that represent for him the peak of human ingenuity), and throws new light on the nature and source of human creativity and inspiration. Published here for the first time, the lectures demonstrate a distinctive approach founded on the raw material of musical perception. Beckh discusses the whistling wind, the billowing wave, the song of the birds and particularly the theme of longing. Never losing the ground from under his feet, he penetrates perennial themes: from the yearning for real spontaneity and the Mystery background uniting heaven and earth, to spiritual knowledge that can meet the demands of the twenty-first century. Out of the cosmic context, Beckh writes to the individual situation. From there, he seeks again the re-won cosmic context. He does not write as a musical specialist and then turn to universal human concerns; rather, Beckh writes from universal human concerns and reveals music as of special concern to everyone. In addition to the transcripts of fifteen lectures, this book contains a valuable introduction and editorial footnotes. It also features appendices including Beckhs essay The Mystery of the Night in Wagner and Novalis; reminiscences of Beckh by August Pauli and Harro Rückner; Donald Francis Toveys Wagnerian harmony and the evolution of the Tristan-chord, and several contemporaneous reviews of Beckhs published works.",Music,en,190.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Shu7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2019.0,complete

ysq8EAAAQBAJ,"The ""Mystery of History"", its Functionalisation and Disintegration in Graham Swifts ""Waterland""",Thorben Höppner,GRIN Verlag,2023-05-02,"Seminar paper from the year 2021 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 1,0, , language: English, abstract: This paper investigates how the ambivalent, perhaps even ambiguous definition of historia relates to the representation of history in the novel and how this representation again relates to its functionalisation by Tom Crick. To answer this question, this paper will primarily work with Linda Hutcheons notion of historiographic metafiction while also pointing out similarities to the reading of Waterland as a trauma narrative. In taking a closer look at the protagonist-narrator himself, this paper argues that the protection from chaos and disorder, which Landow addresses, is only achieved through a form of historical escapism. Superficially speaking, Graham Swifts Waterland is a novel about a history teacher who, having lost his job, forsakes the formal teaching of history, and embarks on an extracurricular journey into his own past. However, upon closer examination, Waterland is more than that, a novel about history itself. It explores the whole mystery of history, as Swift himself puts it in the introduction to the novel (Waterland, xv). Thus, it is only logical that the novel prefaces its narrative with an insightful epigraph: a dictionary definition of the Latin word historia, from which the English word history originates. As can be seen above, however, said definition is ambivalent- it is inherently polysemantic as Judith Ryan notes. James Acheson has likewise pointed out that the fact that historia can mean either history or fiction is significant, for the historian and the writer of fiction must deal with similar problems in writing about the past. The natural tendency of language towards proliferation of its meaning aside, the epigraph leaves us with a very ambivalent concept of history, which the narrative of Waterland, in its dealing with history, then builds on. Since such a prominent theme in Waterland, the novels representation of history has been thoroughly examined in secondary literature; particularly against the theoretical background of what Linda Hutcheon has identified as historiographic metafiction.",Literary Criticism,en,20.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ysq8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2023.0,complete

5kxQDQAAQBAJ,The Mystery and the World,Maria Clara Bingemer,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2016-05-10,"During the past century, an enormous effervescence of events changed the sociopolitical configuration of the world. The interpretation of these facts helped further deepen the crisis in which modern thought already found itself--and it generated the uncertain and unstable environment in which we live today, the so-called postmodernity, late modernity, or hypermodernity. In this context, one of the most profound impacts is most certainly the one on religion. During the twentieth century, religion proved not to be banished from the human horizon as the masters of suspicion intended. Known as the godless century, the twentieth century saw also a resuscitation of the search for the sense of life and spirituality. With the crisis of modern reason, humankind turned toward consumerism and provisional and ""light"" practices. The last century represents not only the height of the postmodernization process but also the rescue of the transcendent and absolute, even if it is an absolute without face and identity. It is in this scenario that religious experiences, apparently exiled by modern rationality, begin to occur and multiply again. Mystical experiences will be, then, the basis for highlighting recurrent characteristics with universal import. But they will show a different configuration than before. One will be able to find them not in so-called sacred spaces but in very secular ones; not so much within institutions but at the borders, or even outside them; not configured by a specific tradition but in an interface that makes more than one tradition meet and dialogue.",Religion,en,401.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5kxQDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2016.0,complete

TvuOAAAAIAAJ,Exeunt Murderers,Anthony Boucher,,1983,"Boucher, a Catholic writer with catholic interests and enthusiasms, wrote short mysteries delving into ""religion, opera, football, politics, movies, true crime, record collecting, and an abundance of good food and wine along with clues and puzzles and deductions.""--Francis M. Nevins, Jr., from his Introduction Most Boucher stories feature brilliant amateur detectives; these are tales of ratiocination in which a splendid quirky intellectual assembles clues and solves mysteries, almost always in time to stop further violence, often without leaving the native habitat to visit the scene of the crime. The first part of this book--""An Ennead of Nobles""--contains nine stories exhibiting the deductive powers of Nick Noble: Lieutenant MacDonald explained about Nick Noble as they drove. ""Nobody knows where he lives or what he lives on. All we know is that we can find him at a little joint on North Main, drinking cheap sherry by the water glass. Sherry's all that life has left him--that, and the ability to make the toughest problem come crystal clear."" The second section--""Conundrums for the Cloister""--shows the vast reasoning power and deep human understanding of Sister Ursula, whose early ill health forced her from a police career into a nunnery. ""Quiet, simple, human, with the unobtrusive but intense inner glow of the devotional life,"" she is the nun variant of G. K. Chesterton's immortal Father Brown.

We Agatha Christie fans read her stories--and particularly her Poirot novels--because the mysteries are invariably equal parts charming and ingenious, dark and quirky and utterly engaging. Sophie Hannah had a massive challenge in reviving the beloved Poirot, and she met it with heart and no small amount of little grey cells. I was thrilled to see the Belgian detective in such very, very good hands. Reading The Monogram Murders was like returning to a favorite room of a long-lost home.  Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl Hercule Poirot returns home after an agreeable luncheon to find an angry woman waiting to berate him outside his front door. Her name is Sylvia Rule, and she demands to know why Poirot has accused her of the murder of Barnabas Pandy, a man she has neither heard of nor ever met. She is furious to be so accused, and deeply shocked. Poirot is equally shocked, because he too has never heard of any Barnabas Pandy, and he certainly did not send the letter in question. He cannot convince Sylvia Rule of his innocence, however, and she marches away in a rage. Shaken, Poirot goes inside, only to find that he has a visitor waiting for him  a man called John McCrodden who also claims also to have received a letter from Poirot that morning, accusing him of the murder of Barnabas Pandy... Poirot wonders how many more letters of this sort have been sent in his name. Who sent them, and why? More importantly, who is Barnabas Pandy, is he dead, and, if so, was he murdered?

Change the past, Save the future. Three high school friends are able to do two things no one else on the planet can do . . . talk with dead people and time travel to the past. For Kelly, its a major adjustment to move from the only life she has ever known in Texas to live with her aunt in Ft. Myers Beach, Florida. She quickly makes friends with her quirky next door neighbor, Scott and his best friend, Austin. In her aunts garage, they find a long-lost invention of Thomas Edison called The Telephone to the Dead. Edison had abandoned the project and given it to Kellys great-great-grandfather. Scott tinkers with it until they can hear sounds coming from it. But instead of broadcasting music . . . it picks up conversations from the dead. As they slowly turn the dial they hear hundreds of sad, lonely voices of souls that have passed but apparently never moved on, pleading for help. A teenagers voice separates from the rest and begs for their help to clear her reputation. They are shocked to find out that she had gone to their own high school . . . 47 years ago. They research the girls story and discover that her name was Wendy and she had been a popular cheerleader who had apparently committed suicide. The teens are touched by Wendys cries and pleas, but they have no way to go back in time to help her. That is, until Scott reveals an nvention of his own . . . a time travel app. Kelly and Austin are very skeptical. Even Scott isnt sure it will work, so they try it out on his sisters pet turtle. Amazingly, the turtle disappears. But did it travel to the past or just wander off? Finally, they decide to humor Scott and go along with his claims of time travel. They meet on the beach after everyone else has gone home. They stand in the formation Scott insists will create the perfect vortex for time travel. At the last moment, a fourth person runs forward and is pulled into their adventure back to 1966. They figure out a way to get close to Wendy without her asking too many questions that they cant answer. But as they discover the secret to her death, they find its not as clear-cut as it would seem. A romance gone wrong, an over-attentive teacher and a young girls dreams for the future are all twisted into a mystery that causes the teens to take greater risks than they could have imagined. It all becomes very real when their own lives are in danger and they realize they may never make it back to the present.

Beaton's beloved Agatha Raisin mystery cozy seriesnow a hit show on Acorn TV and public television. Unlike quite a number of people, Agatha had not given up on Christmas. To have the perfect Christmas had been a childhood dream whilst surviving a rough upbringing in a Birmingham slum. Holly berries glistened, snow fell gently outside, and inside, all was Dickensian jollity. And in her dreams, James Lacey kissed her under the mistletoe, and, like a middle-aged sleeping beauty, she would awake to passion once more.... Agatha Raisin is bored. Her detective agency in the Cotswolds is thriving, but she'll scream if she has to deal with another missing cat or dog. Only two things seem to offer potential excitement: the upcoming Christmas festivities and her ex, James Lacey. This year she is sure that if she invites James to a really splendid, old-fashioned Christmas dinner, their love will rekindle like a warm Yule log. When a wealthy widow hires Agatha because she's convinced a member of her family is trying to kill her, Agatha is intrigued---especially when the widow drops dead after high tea at the manor house.

When things begin to heat up for Camden on the West Coast, he takes a job at a new gym in the small city of Brantford, Ontario.However, Camden, who is hoping for a fresh start, is losing complete control of his emotions. Does Camden stand a chance of keeping his dark deeds a secret when he and Emma move next door to a retired police officer and an overzealous orange tabby cat by the name of Toby? - Detective Toby! Toby has a feline sense for solving crimes, and the moment he meets Camden, he smells trouble!""Are You Listening to Me? is a murder mystery with a comedic, feline twist!An Excerpt...PREFACE: It's been a while since my last big case, so I will jog your memory about who I am. My name is Toby, and I live with Jack Nelson, a retired cop. I used to be quite stout, but since venturing into police work, I have put myself on a rigorous routine of fitness and healthy eating. That doesn't always work out for me because, as my nature dictates, I am inclined to be a tad lazy sometimes--most of the time, actually. And I never miss a meal or a snack if I am passing through the kitchen. My hair is red; I once heard someone say redheads were God's chosen people, so I assume that goes for cats too.Now, do you remember? Yes, I am a cat--Detective Toby. I solved a crime about six months ago when Jack's friend went loony and kidnapped his own kids. I saw through him right from the beginning; Jack didn't. If it hadn't been for me, goodness knows what would have happened to those kids. I was a hero, and everyone was grateful to me. The police department awarded me with a framed certificate, which certified I was a 'Class-A Detective.' I was told I was welcome any time down at the police station, which I take full advantage of every time Jack visits the captain, Bryce Wagner.There have been a lot of changes in the past six months. Jack renovated the back door. I now have my own special cat door so I can come and go from the house as I please. Jack figured if another crime needed investigating, I wouldn't have to wait for someone to open the door to get out and about detectiving if I had my own. There have also been some significant changes on the street. The old gym that used to be owned by Mardy Hampton was sold, and the new owners tore down the old building and are constructing a new one. I heard Jack say they were hoping to have it up and running by early spring. Jack has been talking about getting out of the neighbourhood for a time because he can't sleep well with all the banging going on. Personally, I can sleep through most anything, but the 24-hour noise is starting to get to me, too.At first, I thought Jack was going to move us completely out of the neighbourhood, but was relieved when I saw him just packing for a camping trip in his old campervan. I knew he wouldn't leave me behind since I accompanied him most places now. I won't bore you with the details of our month-long excursion through Northern Ontario because it isn't relevant to the story that is going to unfold in the pages to follow. Enough introductions. You know who I am now and you will be hearing more from me as the story of what happened during the summer of 2009 on the street where I live unfolds.",Fiction,en,266.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uanVwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2018.0,complete

And in this über-stylish mystery, she enlists her no-holds-barred, slightly blonder literary counterpart, Maxine Taylor, to solve a crime of a different sort. When a gorgeous young actress dies on the Red Carpet, some in Tinseltown call it bad publicity. Max calls it murder. The Academy Awards. It's Hollywood's biggest night, and there's no star better equipped than the tart-tongued Max Taylor to hold court on the glamorous Red Carpet. Sharing the dish with her daughter, Drew, the calls-it-as-she-sees-it entertainer has parlayed this star-studded annual gig into television's most-watched pre-show event. And tonight, Max has landed a real coupan exclusive interview with Halsey Hamilton, a fabulous, young, paparazzi-trailed Oscar nominee. But not even Max, who's seen her share of celebrity train wrecks, is prepared for an incoherent Halsey, straight out of rehab, to stumble up to the mic, slur a few cryptic words, and drop dead at the hem of Max's stunning Michael Kors gown. To Hollywood, the starlet's demise was tragic but inevitable. To Max, it looks more like a perfectly calculated crime. After all, she alone heard Halsey's final whispera clue that leads Max to the pricey rehab clinic Wonders. With a weakness for nothing more disturbing than artificial sweeteners, Max nonetheless goes undercover and embarks on a twelve-step investigation into murder. Once inside the luxury clinic, Max's list of suspicious players expands faster than the Jolie-Pitt family: Burke Norris, a professional cad and Drew's ex-fiancé; Halsey's father, who is still making money off his dead daughter's fame; Halsey's jealous younger sister; and Rojo Bernstein, a tattooed karate hipster who knew the troubled fallen star much better than anyone suspected. Now it's left to Max to unravel the sordid motives and find Halsey's killer while upstaging an over-the-top Hollywood memorial service and funeral where the ill-fated actress was buried in, of all things, a tacky designer knockoff! And you thought the Oscars were all swag bags and Jimmy Choos? Hah! Honey, it's murder.

We follow an adventurer through the rarely explored Kerguelen Islands as he is picked up by Len Guy and the crew of the Halbrane on its way home. Before they complete their voyage however they find a corpse drifting on an iceberg, a note with him reveals that William Guy, the captain of the Jane and many of his crew survived the assassination attempt. In a daring voyage to rescue the survivors, we are brought to the frozen, treacherous ice fields of the Antarctic where unimaginably powerful forces have awoken. It is a daring adventure novel, with a riveting plot and powerful conclusion perfect for anyone who loved The Thing. Jules Verne (1828-1905) was a French novelist, poet and playwright who is remembered for his significant contribution to the science fiction genre.

RJfdzgEACAAJ,The Island Mystery,George A. Birmingham,,2021-12-13,"In 1914 there were not twenty men in England who had ever heard of the island of Salissa. Even now--I am writing in the spring of 1917--the public is very badly informed about the events which gave the island a certain importance in the history of the war. A couple of months ago I asked a well-known press-cutting agency to supply me with a complete collection of all references to Salissa which had appeared in our newspapers. I received a single short paragraph from a second-rate society weekly. It ran thus: ""Is it true that our new Minister for Balkan Problems has a curious story to tell about a certain island in the Mediterranean, and is there a lady in the case?"" The Minister referred to is, of course, Sir Bartholomew Bland-Potterton. The island must be Salissa. It is a clear proof, if proof is required, of the efficiency of our press censorship that this should be the only reference to the island in any newspaper in the course of three years. We have blundered a good deal during the war; but it cannot be said of us that we have allowed our press to supply the enemy or any one else with information likely to be of value. Such knowledge as the public now possesses has come to it, not through newspapers, but by way of gossip. Sir Bartholomew sometimes talks, and the words of a man in his position are repeated in the smoking-rooms of clubs, round tea tables and elsewhere. Unfortunately gossip of this kind is most unreliable. The tendency is to exaggerate the picturesque parts of the story and to misinterpret motives. It is slanderous, for instance, to suggest that Sir Bartholomew was in any way attracted by the lady who bore the title of Queen of Salissa. He never spoke to her or even saw her. His interest in the Salissa affair was that of a patriotic statesman. He told me this himself, yesterday after dinner. It was Sir Bartholomew who drew my attention to the exhaustive monograph on the Island of Salissa written by Professor Homer Geldes, of Pearmount University, Pa., U.S.A. The book was published ten years ago, but has never been widely read. I am indebted to the professor for the following information.",,en,95.0,,,,google_books_api,,2021.0,incomplete

Biggers employs a narrative style marked by wit and cultural observations, reflecting the societal shifts of his era. Set against colorful backdrops from Victorian England to the exotic landscapes of the Far East, these tales feature unforgettable protagonists like the iconic detective Charlie Chan, who navigates the complexities of crime with both intellect and moral integrity, highlighting the themes of justice and cultural divergence. Earl Derr Biggers (1884-1933) carved a niche in the detective genre, drawing from his perspectives and experiences as a journalist and playwright. His fascination with the East, particularly after a trip to Hawaii, informed his creation of Charlie Chan as a counter-narrative to prevailing stereotypes, promoting a nuanced representation of Asian characters. Biggers' work resonates with the changing dynamics of American society, addressing both the allure and the peril of the unknown. This anthology not only represents a significant archivist contribution to mystery literature but also invites readers to engage with the thematic elements of culture and morality. Ideal for lovers of classic detective stories, this collection promises intrigue and insight, establishing Biggers as a cornerstone in the genre's evolution.",Fiction,en,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zSDjEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2023.0,complete

Readers at all levels can continue to deepen their understanding of this rich tale about the Lover and his quest--against the admonishments of Reason and the obstacles set by Jealousy and Resistance--to pluck the fair Rose in the Enchanted Garden.

His new preface reviews selected scholarship through 1990, which examines, for example, the sources and influences of the work, the two authors, the nature of the allegorical narrative as a genre, the use of first person, and the poem's early reception.

She demonstrates that these writers - confronted with ever more reified exclusion from public life, and relegated to narrowly defined domestic roles - intervened in and subverted the process in their novels. Daniels shows that women writers used the novel first to imagine different social rules that might define alternative kinship systems (Graffigny), and later to find - and create - loopholes within a firmly entrenched system of official and unofficial law (Charriere and Sand).""

Blodgett,Psychology Press,1995,"""Variously described as a comedy of manners, a psychological romance, and a type of fabliau, the 13th-century narrative Flamenca is the best medieval romance written in Occitan. Its uniqueness springs from qualities that anticipate the preoccupations of modern-day narrative. Not content with being a love story fraught with risk and intrigue, the poem is layered with responses to the troubadour tradition of love and poetry, as well as the Bible and the classics. Though among the most bookish of romances, its tone is invariably ironic, comic, and satirical. This playfulness may be measured by the variety and vehemence of critical response to the poem. Is it a vindication of the troubadour ideal, a mockery of the Church, a satire on jealous husbands, or an undermining of the ideals that romance is said to inscribe? Or is it all of these elements held in suspense?

The pastoral heroine's task is paradoxical: to break out of her pastoral paradise in order to ensure its reconstitution. She is the princess, the shepherdess, the Lady, or the virtuous daughter who becomes a repository of honor and virtue in a changing society where traditional chivalric definitions of honor hold decreasing purchase. This groundbreaking book examines the typical challenges facedby the pastoral romance heroine as she matures within the pastoral locus amoenus: the foundling dilemma; the loop-shaped quest: the rhetorical battle; the chastity threat; the reconciliation of beauty to virtue; and familial reunification. It illustrates how the allegorical, symbolic, and psychological characterizations of pastoral heroines in the works of Sidney, Spenser, Wroth, Fletcher, Milton, and Marvell anticipate developments in the representation of female subjectivities normally associated with the novel.

-e8pCgAAQBAJ,Vowel Length From Latin to Romance,Michele Loporcaro,OUP Oxford,2015-07-31,"This book investigates the changes that affected vowel length during the development of Latin into the Romance languages and dialects. In Latin, vowel length was contrastive (e.g. pila 'ball' vs. pila 'pile', like English bit vs. beat), but no modern Romance language has retained that same contrast. However, many non-standard Romance dialects (as well as French, up to the early 20th century) have developed novel vowel length contrasts, which are investigated in detail here. Unlike previous studies of this phenomenon, this book combines detailed historical evidence spanning three millennia (as attested by extant texts) with extensive data from present-day Romance varieties collected from first-hand fieldwork, which are subjected to both phonological and experimental phonetic analysis. Professor Loporcaro puts forward a detailed account of the loss of contrastive vowel length in late Latin, showing that this happened through the establishment of a process which lengthened all stressed vowels in open syllables, as in modern Italian casa 'ka:sa. His analysis has implications for many of the most widely-debated issues relating to the origin of novel vowel length contrasts in Romance, which are also shown to have been preserved to different degrees in different areas. The detailed investigation of the rise and fall of vowel length in dozens of lesser-known (non-standard) varieties is crucial in understanding the development of this aspect of Romance historical phonology, and will be of interest not only to researchers and students in comparative Romance linguistics, but also, more generally, to phonologists and those interested in historical linguistics beyond the Latin-Romance language family.",Language Arts & Disciplines,en,327.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-e8pCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2015.0,complete

i9hlEQAAQBAJ,Manual of Romance Forensic Linguistics,"Victoria Guillén-Nieto, Dieter Stein",Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2025-06-02,"It is evident that published, serious, science-based work in Forensic Linguistics is predominantly written in English and focuses on casework from the English-speaking world. While the first aspect is understandable  given that English serves as an international lingua franca in scientific discourse , the second aspect presents a significant limitation for the field. Should researchers assume that there is simply less crime in non-English-speaking areas of the world? A more pertinent question might be: What cultural, disciplinary, legal, or legal-cultural factors contribute to the lack of research in (and on) languages other than English? In addition to addressing the underrepresentation of Romance languages in scientific publications related to forensic work, the chapters in this handbook will also explore the reasons behind this unfortunate situation. Designed to engage readers, whether they are linguists, legal professionals, or simply interested individuals, and to spark interest in Romance Forensic Linguistics, this handbook follows three key objectives: First, we are committed to providing a comprehensive overview of the casework and research conducted in (and on) several Romance languages, including Peninsular Spanish, Catalan, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Canadian French, Italian, and Romanian. Second, the chapters in this volume seek to understand why Forensic Linguistics has thrived more in some Romance-speaking countries than in others.

HaNREQAAQBAJ,The O'Ruddy A Romance,Stephen Crane,Namaskar Books,2025-03-27,"The O'Ruddy: A Romance by Stephen Crane is a captivating narrative that captures the essence of love, adventure, and the often tumultuous interplay of personal ambition and societal expectations. Set against the backdrop of the late 19th century, this novel combines elements of romance, humor, and social commentary, showcasing Crane's masterful storytelling and keen observation of human character. Through a tale marked by spirited dialogue and vivid imagery, Crane invites readers into a world where passion and intrigue intertwine, inviting both laughter and reflection. The story follows the life of the protagonist, Peter ORuddy, an American who arrives in London with grand aspirations of becoming a successful writer and making his mark in the world. However, it quickly becomes evident that life does not conform to our visions of success and glamour. Instead, O'Ruddy's journey is full of unexpected twists and turns, illuminating the struggles that accompany the pursuit of dreams. This theme resonates deeply with readers, as it reflects the universal quest for identity and fulfillment. Crane skillfully illustrates how societal norms and personal ambitions can clash, forcing individuals to navigate not only external hurdles but also their inner desires. At the heart of the narrative lies a passionate romance that develops between O'Ruddy and the enchanting Lady Connie. Their relationship serves as a lens through which Crane explores themes of love, maturity, and the sacrifices individuals make for those they cherish. ORuddy's infatuation with Lady Connie is palpable, revealing the intoxicating qualities of young love while also highlighting its complexities. The way Crane crafts their connection provides depth to the story, shifting the focus from a simple romantic subplot to a more profound exploration of relational dynamics in a world that often prioritizes status over emotion. As O'Ruddy grapples with his feelings for Lady Connie, he also faces pressures from the upper echelons of society, represented by characters who embody aristocracy and privilege. Cranes portrayal of the British upper class is both satirical and insightful, revealing the absurdities and pretensions that accompany wealth and status. ORuddy, often depicted as a man of the people, finds himself navigating the complexities of social class, which fosters a rich commentary on the nature of identity and societal acceptance. Crane's keen observations serve to challenge readers' perspectives on class distinctions and the inherent value of individuals regardless of their social standing. The novel is punctuated by Crane's trademark prose style, characterized by sharp wit and vivid imagery that brings scenes to life. His descriptions are not merely decorative; they enhance the understanding of his characters emotions and motivations. The clever dialogue crackles with humor and insight, making each interaction between characters engaging and memorable. This stylistic choice contributes to the overall buoyancy of the narrative, allowing readers to become fully immersed in the world Crane has created. Crane also employs irony throughout the novel to emphasize the discrepancy between expectations and reality. O'Ruddys romantic aspirations often collide with the harsh truths of life, leading to moments of both comedy and poignant self-reflection. This interplay creates a nuanced exploration of the human experience, as it mirrors the ups and downs of love and ambition that many individuals face. Crane's deft handling of irony elevates the narrative, making it not just a love story, but a deeper examination of the intricacies of human emotions and desires. The setting of the novel further anchors the story in a vibrant historical context. Crane effectively uses London as a backdrop, capturing its bustling streets, grand estates, and the distinct cultural milieu of the time. The city acts almost as a character in its own right, influencing the lives of O'Ruddy and Lady Connie. This detail enriches the narrative, offering readers a sense of place that is both tangible and evocative. As O'Ruddy navigates the challenges of his romance and aspirations within this dynamic environment, the backdrop serves to heighten the stakes of his journey. Ultimately, The O'Ruddy is a tale of resilienceof a man striving to reconcile his dreams with the realities of love and societal expectations.

CqRREQAAQBAJ,One Woman Being The Second Part of a Romance of Sussex,Alfred Ollivant,Namaskar Books,2025-03-27,"One Woman: Being the Second Part of a Romance of Sussex by Alfred Ollivant is a captivating exploration of love, desire, and the complexities of human relationships set against the picturesque backdrop of the English countryside. First published in 1910, this novel serves as a sequel to Ollivant's earlier work, The Romance of Sussex, and delves deep into the lives of its characters as they navigate the trials and tribulations of love, class, and social expectations in a rapidly changing world. Ollivant, known for his keen observations and insightful characterizations, masterfully crafts a narrative that intertwines the lives of its protagonists with the rich and evocative landscape of Sussex. The story centers on characters whose interactions reveal the nuances of romantic entanglements and the often unpredictable nature of love. At its heart, One Woman is a testament to the idea that love can be both a source of joy and anguish, serving as a poignant reminder of the intricacies of the human heart. The novel follows the life of the protagonist, John Wreight, who finds himself entangled in a complex relationship with the captivating and enigmatic woman, Maud. Maud embodies the tensions between tradition and modernity, as she represents both the societal expectations placed on women and the burgeoning desire for independence and self-definition in the early 20th century. Through Johns eyes, readers are invited to witness the evolution of their relationship, marked by moments of passion, misunderstanding, and emotional turmoil. Ollivants nuanced portrayal of Maud highlights the struggles faced by women during this period, evoking empathy and reflection on the societal constraints that shape their lives. The author showcases his skill in developing rich, multidimensional characters, each with their own dreams, flaws, and motivations. As the narrative unfolds, readers encounter a diverse cast of supporting characters, each adding depth to the story and contributing to the central themes of love and loss. The relationships between these characters echo the societal norms of the time, prompting a reflection on class dynamics, gender roles, and the impact of societal expectations on personal happiness. Ollivants descriptive prose brings the Sussex countryside to life, offering readers vivid imagery of its rolling hills, quaint villages, and the vibrant atmosphere of rural life. The setting becomes a character in itself, reflecting the characters' emotions and struggles. The natural beauty of Sussex juxtaposed with the tumultuous nature of love serves as a backdrop for personal discovery and transformation. Ollivants ability to infuse the landscape with emotional resonance enhances the reading experience, allowing readers to feel the weight of the characters journeys. The tension between individual desires and societal expectations is a recurring motif throughout the novel. As Maud grapples with her identity and place within a patriarchal society, her struggle becomes emblematic of broader issues faced by women during the early 20th century. Ollivants exploration of this theme resonates with readers even today, inviting contemplation on the evolving roles of women and the ongoing quest for autonomy and self-fulfillment. At its core, One Woman is not just a story of romantic love but also an exploration of the concept of female agency. As Maud navigates her relationship with John and the societal pressures that surround her, the novel raises important questions about the nature of love, commitment, and personal freedom. Ollivants sensitive portrayal of these themes prompts readers to consider the complexities of emotional bonds and the sacrifices individuals make for love. The narrative structure of the novel is engaging, with compelling dialogue and emotional depth that bring the characters to life. Ollivants writing showcases an impressive balance between storytelling and lyrical prose, drawing readers into the emotional landscape of the characters experiences. His ability to shift between moments of levity and intensity keeps the reader engrossed, resulting in a rich and rewarding reading experience. In conclusion, One Woman: Being the Second Part of a Romance of Sussex is a timeless exploration of love, identity, and the intricate dance of human relationships. Alfred Ollivants keen insight into the human psyche, coupled with his vivid descriptions of the Sussex landscape, creates a compelling narrative that resonates across generations. By delving into the complexities of love and the societal constraints that shape individual choices, Ollivant crafts a story that is both intimately personal and universally relevant. This novel remains a significant work in the landscape of early 20th-century literature, inviting readers to reflect on the enduring challenges of romance, autonomy, and the quest for happiness.",Fiction,en,264.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CqRREQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2025.0,complete

The gate, in its totality, consisted of five bars, after the custom of orthodox gates. It stood open of necessity. How could it do otherwise, seeing that its diagonal backbone - the board that ran slantwise from its lower left-hand corner to its upper right-hand corner, - had yielded to the persistent persuasions of gravity and had parted in the middle? The young man who stood contemplating the structure was dressed in a loosely careless fashion, though an observant woman, looking him over, would have seen that his carelessly worn garments were made of a superior cloth and fashioned by highly skilled hands.

Which is fine by them, because they want to send her off on a different kind of trip: to prove that someone suffering from a breakup can avoid a knee-jerk rebound affair and manage NOT to fall in love. To emphasize the point, they will NOT assign her a new tour guide. Instead, Keira will take a cruise to the Scandinavian countries and have to navigate herself. Keira is thrilled to accept the assignment. There is nothing she wants more than to be alone, and go to the Northern climes, where she can cool her head, and where surely she will not find love.

Raft was a big red-headed man with eyes that seemed always roving over great distances as though in search of something. He was thirty-two years of age and he had used the sea since twelve - twenty years. His past was a long succession of fo'c'sles, bar-rooms, blazing suns, storms and sea happen ings so run together that all sequence was lost. Beyond them lay a dismal blotch, his childhood. He had entered the world and literally and figuratively had been laid at the door of a work house; of his childhood he remembered little, of his parentage he knew nothing. In drink he was quiet, but most dangerous under certain provocations.

m3SEzwEACAAJ,Transformation,Nathaniel Hawthorne,,2020-07-28,"The Marble Faun: Or, The Romance of Monte Beni, also known by the British title Transformation, was the last of the four major romances by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and was published in 1860. The Marble Faun, written on the eve of the American Civil War, is set in a fantastical Italy. The romance mixes elements of a fable, pastoral, gothic novel, and travel guide. This romance focuses on four main characters: Miriam, Hilda, Kenyon, and Donatello. Miriam is a beautiful painter with an unknown past. Throughout the novel, she is compared to many other women including Eve, Beatrice Cenci, Judith, and Cleopatra. Miriam is pursued by a mysterious, threatening man who is her ""evil genius"" through life. Hilda is an innocent copyist. She is compared to the Virgin Mary and the white dove. Her simple, unbendable moral principles can make her severe in spite of her tender heart. Miriam and Hilda are often contrasted. Kenyon is a sculptor who represents rationalist humanism. He cherishes a romantic affection towards Hilda. Donatello, the Count of Monte Beni, is often compared to Adam and is in love with Miriam. Donatello amazingly resembles the marble Faun of Praxiteles, and the novel plays with the characters' belief that the Count may be a descendant of the antique Faun. Hawthorne, however, withholds a definite statement even in the novel's concluding chapters and postscript.",,en,0.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m3SEzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2020.0,incomplete

DEF8tAEACAAJ,Staging Early Modern Romance,"Mary Ellen Lamb, Valerie Wayne",Routledge Studies in Renaissan,2009,"This collection recovers the continuities between three forms of romance that have often been separated from one another in critical discourse: early modern prose fiction, the dramatic romances staged in England during the 1570s and 1580s, and Shakespeare's late plays. Although Pericles, Cymbeline, Winter's Tale, and The Tempest have long been characterized as ""romances,"" their connections with the popular prose romances of their day and the dramatic romances that preceded them have frequently been overlooked. Constructed to explore those connections, this volume includes original essays that relate at least one prose or dramatic romance to an English play written from 1570 to 1630. The introduction explores the use of the term ""dramatic romance"" over several centuries and the commercial association between print culture, gender, and drama. Eight essays discuss Shakespeare's plays; three more examine plays by Beaumont, Fletcher, and Massinger. Other authors treated at some length include Boccaccio, Christine de Pizan, Chaucer, Sidney, Greene, Lodge, and Wroth. Barbara Mowat's afterword considers Shakespeare's use of Greek romance. Written by foremost scholars of Shakespeare and early modern prose fiction, this book explores the vital cross-currents that occurred between narrative and dramatic forms of Greek, medieval, and early modern romance.",Literary Criticism,en,261.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DEF8tAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2009.0,complete

But the savage in him wanted to take her now, with or without her invitation...And yet there was something more about her that helped him win the battle and overthrow his baser nature. Something he'd recognised at the auction. Something he intuitively knew he'd never discover if he gave in to his cravings and forced himself upon her. No. Instead, Dominicus knew he needed to exercise persuasion..."" Her Master's Slave is a passionate historical romance adventure set in ancient Rome during the despotic reign of Emperor Nero. It is the first book in the series: Tales from Ancient Rome to Entertain  Enthral. Each book can be read as a stand-alone, but Nero will be a familiar character in all subsequent Tales; bringing chaos, turmoil or salvation depending on his whim and how he's feeling on the day... If you love fast-paced ancient world historical romance and the perils of falling in love during such a turbulent era, Her Master's slave will transport you to a world of pure escapism, entertainment and occasional palpitations where you can fall in love with feisty heroines and strong, rugged, slightly over-bearing hero's - who ultimately get tamed. Adult themes, dark imagery and humour are touched upon but overall this is simply a fun, entertaining tale suitable for adults who love to read adventure and romance.

VMoTswEACAAJ,Gabrielle of the Lagoon,A. Safroni-Middleton,,2015-07-09,"Excerpt from Gabrielle of the Lagoon: A Romance of the South Seas Though it was night and there was no moon, a dim, wierd light lay over the isle and pierced to the depths of the forests. It was in the Solomons, where the dark, picturesque surroundings of palm and reef, the noise of the distant surfs, made a suitable setting for anything unexpected. Even the silver sea-birds had weird, startled-looking eyes down Felisi beach way. And when the wild brown men crept away from the grave-side of one whom they had just buried in the forest, the winds sighed a fitting music across the primeval heights. But there was nothing strange in that; men must die wherever one goes, and it was a common enough occurrence in that heathen land where the ocean boomed on the one side and inland to the south-west stood the mountains, looking like mighty monuments erected in memory of the first dark ages. Across the skies of Bougainville the stars had been marshalled in the millions. It seemed a veritable heathen faeryland as the night echoed a hollow ""Tarabab!"" But even that heathenish word was only the tribal chief's yell as he stood under the palms conducting the semi-religious tambu ceremony. The tawny maidens and high chiefs, with their feather head-dresses, all in full festival costume, were squatting in front of the secret tambu stage, some mumbling prayer, others beating their hands together as an accompaniment.

9Z_vsgEACAAJ,The Romance of a Midshipman (Classic Reprint),William Clark Russell,,2015-06-29,"Excerpt from The Romance of a Midshipman I was at Bouville, a little dusky seaport situated on the French coast betwixt Brest and placid old Calais. One long pier strikes fang-like with a flash into the breaches of the sea and the wild play of foam makes a light for that gray and gloomy harbor. The gloom is in the black timbers of pier, in the dark green sheathing of seaweed, in an appearance of darkness in the water where it spreads its inmost extremity. Bouville is full of churches. It may be that in my time you might count one for every hundred head of man and woman. Better for the inhabitants if their spires were of commerce, and smoked; but the weather-cock darts a flame as it revolves, and is an ornament in the air. The harbor is the pleasantest part. I always thought it so when a boy. I was fascinated by the clumsy black smacks, and their huge chocolate lugs, and their deck-loads of gabbling, sprawling men, and noisy, gesticulating women, in immense caps and shining earrings. These poor people are very devout. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

jiZEngEACAAJ,"Sex, Love, and Romance in the Mass Media",Mary-Lou Galician,Routledge,2004-07-16,"This accessible yet research-based text offers both foundational theories and practical applications of analysis and criticism of mass media portrayals of sex, love, and romance in a wide variety of mass media, from entertainment to advertising to news. The multidisciplinary methodological perspective comes out of a media literacy approach and embraces a variety of traditions along the quantitative-qualitative continuum. Focused on portrayals of male-female coupleship, the book is centered around the 12 major myths and stereotypes of Galician's Dr. FUN!'s Mass Media Love Quiz, each of which has a corresponding Dr. Galician Prescription that encapsulates healthy strategies--rarely found in the mass media--to counteract that myth or stereotype. Readers learn how to identify, illustrate, deconstruct, evaluate, and reframe the mass media's mythic and stereotypic portrayals of sex, love, and romance. They also learn how to use their own formal critical evaluations to clarify their own values and--as media consumers or mass communication creators--to share their insights with others. Thus, the learning objectives encompass all three major educational domains: cognitive, affective, and behavioral. Part I of this book covers the five foundations: myths and stereotypes of love and coupleship; models of realistic and constructive love and coupleship; mass media storytelling approaches, techniques, and devices; research and theories of mass media effects; and strategies and skills of media literacy. Part II is devoted to exploring the myths and stereotypes identified in the Quiz. Following several brief case studies and a summary of related research and commentary, each chapter focuses on analyses and criticisms of portrayals of sex, love, and romance in the content of news and advertising, as well as entertainment using Galician's Seven-Step Dis-illusioning Directions. Each chapter concludes with a ""Dis-illusion Digest."" While critical of unrealistic portrayals and the damage they can cause unsuspecting media consumers, Galician--a media literacy advocate--is not anti-media. Rather, her goal is to empower consumers to use these portrayals with more awareness of their possible consequences, to resist adopting them as models for actual behavior, and to consciously reframe them into more realistic, productive scenarios. This unique text is an engaging classroom resource for media literacy, media and relationships, and media and society coursework.",Family & Relationships,en,200.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jiZEngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2004.0,complete

iN8btAEACAAJ,The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck,Mary Shelley,Forgotten Books,2018-01-31,"Excerpt from The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck: A Romance The story of Perkin Warbeck was first suggested to me as a subject for historical detail. On studying it, I became aware of the romance which his story contains, while, at the same time, I felt that it would be impossible for any narration, that should be confined to the incorporation of facts related by our old Chroniclers, to do it justice. It is not singular that I should entertain a belief that Perkin was, in reality, the lost duke of York. For, in spite of Hume, and the later historians who have followed in his path, no person who has at all studied the subject but arrives at the same con elusion. Records exist in the Tower, some well known, others with which those 'who have access to those interesting papers are alone acquainted, which put the question almost beyond a doubt.

At the time it was written it represented a shift by Scott away from fairly realistic novels set in Scotland in the comparatively recent past, to a somewhat fanciful depiction of medieval England.It has proved to be one of the best known and most influential of Scott's novels.Ivanhoe is set in 12th-century England with colourful descriptions of a tournament, outlaws, a witch trial and divisions between Jews and Christians.It has been credited for increasing interest in romance and medievalism; John Henry Newman claimed Scott ""had first turned men's minds in the direction of the Middle Ages"", while Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin made similar assertions of Scott's overwhelming influence over the revival, based primarily on the publication of this novel.It has also had an important influence on popular perceptions of Richard the Lionheart, King John and Robin Hood.",,en,774.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rUNrzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2021.0,incomplete

But when he is summoned to his brother's deathbed, he learns his treacherous kin has secretly wed and fathered a son. Vowing to claim what is rightfully his, Liam contests his nephew's succession.

Now widowed, she must protect her young son from her husband's vengeful brother who will stop at nothing-including murder-to take what does not belong to him. But when she seeks an audience with the king to secure her son's inheritance, she discovers Sir Liam may have the stronger claim and that the truth of him could make lies of all she was led to believe.

Seeking other habitable planets, the spaceship Callisto embarks on a tour of the solar system that takes it to Jupiter, a wilderness paradise, and Saturn, where secrets about the fate of man are revealed.

She considers key issues in feminist debate, in particular the relations of feminist to the poststructuralist theories of Lacan, Derrida, and Foucault.

nxGuDwAAQBAJ,The Happily Ever After,Avi Steinberg,Nan A. Talese,2020-08-11,"A memoir about writing a novel about searching for love. Is romance dead? Is that why there are so many vampires in today's romance novels? When Avi Steinberg's love life took a grim turn, he did what he always does: He consulted his old books, the usual cast of Great (Very Serious, Usually Male) Authors. And he immediately realized that these books were part of the problem. Instead, he began to read romances, the books he--like so many of us--have been conditioned to dismiss as ""trashy."" What he discovered was a genre that was tremendously diverse and daring, along with a vast network of innovative writers who were keeping the novel as alive as ever. His own relationship problems, he realized, came down to a failure of his imagination. And so he set out on a quest to write and publish a romance novel and to find real-life love. A hybrid of memoir, travelogue, and critical essay, The Happily Ever After chronicles an adventure in a brave new world of literature. Steinberg offers a report from the trenches of romance, moving between major industry conferences and writing groups at the local bar as he works and reworks his romance novel idea. He reveals the inside scoop from a major romance publishing house, crisscrosses the country meeting mysterious ghostwriters and Fabio's great unsung rival, and offers a running take on the fascinating history of romance writing, the genre that invented, and continues to reinvent, the modern novel. Along the way he meets many readers, each of whom sheds light on why we are so fascinated by--and phobic of--romance fiction and what the vitality and fractiousness of our biggest genre says about us. With quirky wit and disarming honesty, Steinberg captures an often misunderstood literary culture and learns, from its devoted practitioners, how to take the Happily Ever After seriously in his own life.",Biography & Autobiography,en,180.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nxGuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2020.0,complete

The long terraces on the eastern side of the hill topped by Windsor Castle lay luminously green in the long light of the declining sun; while the last of these, bordering on the forest, was mottled with the deep, velvet shadows of the ancient oaks near by. This space was alive with the moving figures of a company of young men and youths of various ages; all of them, judging from the richness of their dress, members of the royal household. They wore tunics reaching scarcely to the knee, far shorter than those in vogue for older men; belts of wrought silver or leather studded with gold; hose, party-colored or plain; and long, pointed shoes of cloth, which were by no means easy to run in. Bareheaded were they all; and their locks, not long since carefully combed and curled, though dishevelled now, hung upon their shoulders. Two or three only bore traces of wished-for beards; and, judging by the mellow echoes of their shouts and laughter, the majority of voices among them was still unchanged. The younger members of this group were engaged in a variety of games: wrestling, racing, balls, archery, and spaume.

Providing fresh insight into the development of the novel, this study identifies the politicisation of erotic romance by the European philhellene (lovers of all things Greek) Protestant movement. To English translators and authors, the complex plots, well developed moralised characters (particularly female) and rhetorical styles of the ancient novels signify political and social reform. Generous quotation and translations ensure that European Erotic Romance is accessible to a broad spectrum of readers. Its organisation lends itself to use as a course text.

They're after her again, and all that's standing between her and the darkest fate imaginable is me. Serena: It's scary the things you can close your eyes to. Even after I was rescued from men who wanted to do the worst things to me, I went on with my life. I forgot all about the threats of the mafia, about what they forced me to do, and even the man who saved me from them. But now, my hero has returned, and just in a nick of time. Because the mafia is coming for me, and this time, I don't know if we're going to get out of this alive.",,en,354.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QZm4uQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2018.0,incomplete

EYzOAwAAQBAJ,Talking Dirty on Sex and the City,Beatriz Oria,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,2014-06-05,"First broadcast on HBO in 1998, Sex and the City quickly became a mainstream success. Following four women who navigate the promise and peril of social, political, and sexual relationships in New York, the series caused a stir in the popular media. Academia also responded with a remarkable body of criticism for such an apparently trivial program. But more than ten years after the show ended, there is still much more to say about this cultural phenomenon that spawned two film sequels. In Talking Dirty on Sex and the City: Romance, Intimacy, Friendship, Beatriz Oria explores the discourses surrounding the series from a sociological point of view. Specifically, this book focuses on the conventions of the romantic comedy genre and how its familiar fictional world articulates issues of intimacy, gender identity, and interpersonal relationships. Oria considers how generic conventions employed by the show affect discourses on intimacy and how interpersonal relationships at the turn of the century have not only been represented but also fashioned through a relevant popular-culture text. The author also explores such elements as romantic versus democratic love, the representation of female sexuality, and new family models. With an interdisciplinary approach, this book touches on many different areas, including sociology, psychology, gender studies, and media studies. Aimed at a broad academic audience, Talking Dirty on Sex and the City will also appeal to longtime fans, who are no doubt still gossiping about the show.",Performing Arts,en,215.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EYzOAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2014.0,complete

mkrYEAAAQBAJ,History and Story in the American Political Thriller Film,Pablo Castrillo Maortua,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,2023-08-29,"In this book, Pablo Castrillo Maortua analyzes the emergence of the political thriller in Hollywood at a time of angst and turmoil in the United States. The Cold War, the nuclear age, domestic and international scandals, and an increasingly deceitful political culture catalyzed a filmmaking current that would gradually develop its own narrative form and aesthetics into a new genre. Castrillo Maortua explores the dramatic identity and design of the American political thriller, tracking the close correlation between the evolution of the genre and the history of the United States from the Cuban Missile Crisis to the 911 terrorist attacks and the ensuing War on Terror. Ultimately, the author demonstrates how the American political thriller defies Hollywood conventions and cultural presuppositions with an entertaining yet critical view of the state of politics. Scholars of film studies, screenwriting, and genre theory will find this book of particular interest.",Performing Arts,en,293.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mkrYEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2023.0,complete

The Sunday Times 'The most exciting, involving thriller I've read in an age, and I can't recommend it highly enough.' Mick Herron  A Treachery of Spies is an espionage thriller to rival the very best, a high stakes game of cat-and-mouse, played in the shadows, which will keep you guessing every step of the way. A body has been found. The elderly victims identity has been cleverly obscured but one thing is clear: she has been killed in the manner of traitors to the Resistance in World War Two. To find answers in the present, police inspector Inès Picaut must look to the past; to 1940s France, a time of sworn allegiances and broken promises, where the men and women of the Resistance fought for survival against Nazi invaders.

Манфред Кюн развеивает этот миф раз и навсегда.Жизнь Канта (17241804) охватывает почти весь XVIII век, и период его зрелости совпадает с некоторыми из самых значительных изменений в западном мире, многие из которых до сих пор отражаются на нашей жизни. Это было время, когда зародилось современное мировоззрение, и из этой биографии видно, что философия Канта была выражением этой новой концепции современности и откликом на нее. Его интеллектуальная жизнь отражает наиболее значительные явления того периода в области мысли, науки и политики, от литературного движения Буря и натиск до таких отдаленных событий, как Французская и Американская революции.С учетом новейших исследований профессор Кюн позволяет читателю (независимо от того, интересуется ли тот философией, историей, политикой, немецкой культурой или религией) проследовать по тому же пути, по которому прошел сам Кант: от ученого, сосредоточенного на метафизических основаниях ньютоновской науки, до великого мыслителя, выступающего в защиту морали просвещенного гражданина мира.В формате PDF A4 сохранен издательский макет.",Biography & Autobiography,ru,1147.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y4RbEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2022.0,complete
EtpwDwAAQBAJ,A Companion to Literary Biography,Richard Bradford,John Wiley & Sons,2018-11-28,"An authoritative review of literary biography covering the seventeenth century to the twentieth century A Companion to Literary Biography offers a comprehensive account of literary biography spanning the history of the genre across three centuries. The editor  an esteemed literary biographer and noted expert in the field  has encouraged contributors to explore the theoretical and methodological questions raised by the writing of biographies of writers. The text examines how biographers have dealt with the lives of classic authors from Chaucer to contemporary figures such as Kingsley Amis. The Companion brings a new perspective on how literary biography enables the reader to deal with the relationship between the writer and their work. Literary biography is the most popular form of writing about writing, yet it has been largely neglected in the academic community. This volume bridges the gap between literary biography as a popular genre and its relevance for the academic study of literature. This important work: Allows the author of a biography to be treated as part of the process of interpretation and investigates biographical reading as an important aspect of criticism Examines the birth of literary biography at the close of the seventeenth century and considers its expansion through the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries Addresses the status and writing of literary biography from numerous perspectives and with regard to various sources, methodologies and theories Reviews the ways in which literary biography has played a role in our perception of writers in the mainstream of the English canon from Chaucer to the present day Written for students at the undergraduate level, through postgraduate and doctoral levels, as well as academics, A Companion to Literary Biography illustrates and accounts for the importance of the literary biography as a vital element of criticism and as an index to our perception of literary history.",Biography & Autobiography,en,628.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EtpwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2018.0,complete

Fourteen scholars analyze the agenda, problems, and strengths of biographical material, highlighting the flaws, deficiencies, and influences that have distorted the portraits of women such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Hays, Sydney Owenson, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Felicia Hemans, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Caroline Norton, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charlotte Brontë, Lady Florence Dixie, George Eliot, and Edith Simcox. Through exposing distortions, this fascinating study demonstrates that biographies are often more about the biographer than they are about the biographee and that they are products of the time in which they are written.",Literary Criticism,en,296.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M8I9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2017.0,complete

A thorough and interdisciplinary work, Unpacking the Kists is the first in-depth study of New Zealand's Scots migrants and their impact on an evolving settler society. The authors establish the dimensions of Scottish migration to New Zealand, the principal source areas, the migrants' demographic characteristics, and where they settled in the new land. Drawing from extended case-studies, they examine how migrants adapted to their new environment and the extent of longevity in diverse areas including the economy, religion, politics, education, and folkways. They also look at the private worlds of family, neighbourhood, community, customs of everyday life and leisure pursuits, and expressions of both high and low forms of transplanted culture. Adding to international scholarship on migrations and cultural adaptations, Unpacking the Kists demonstrates the historic contributions Scots made to New Zealand culture by retaining their ethnic connections and at the same time interacting with other ethnic groups.",History,en,350.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JesFgWBgh_IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2013.0,complete
8UeAEQAAQBAJ,Parental Death,Michelle Shreeve,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2018-04-20,"According to a recent U.S. census, approximately 2.5 million children under the age of eighteen have experienced the death of a parent. Losing a parent at such a young age can have devastating consequences. Beyond the grief children and young adults experience, they can be at risk for many negative outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms, as well as diminished self-esteem. Their academic success and relationships with others can also be adversely affected. For these young adults, help is not always easy to find. In Parental Death: The Ultimate Teen Guide, Michelle Shreeve offers a variety of ways in which young people can cope with this tough experience. In addition to outlining the universal difficulties of losing a parent, the author also points out the unique dynamics of specific losses--sons who lose fathers, daughters who lose mothers, sons who lose mothers, and daughters who lose fathersand what those losses can mean for their future development. This book also identifies how the challenges of life without a parent can affect a young adult at different stages. Featuring real stories and quotes from teens about their experiences, this book shows young adults a variety of views about the death of a parent, and provides coping strategies that young people can call upon to help them through this difficulty.

04wtDwAAQBAJ,Madness and the Romantic Poet,James Whitehead,Oxford University Press,2017-07-21,"Madness and the Romantic Poet examines the longstanding and enduringly popular idea that poetry is connected to madness and mental illness. The idea goes back to classical antiquity, but it was given new life at the turn of the nineteenth century. The book offers a new and much more complete history of its development than has previously been attempted, alongside important associated ideas about individual genius, creativity, the emotions, rationality, and the mind in extreme states or disorder - ideas that have been pervasive in modern popular culture. More specifically, the book tells the story of the initial growth and wider dissemination of the idea of the 'Romantic mad poet' in the nineteenth century, how (and why) this idea became so popular, and how it interacted with the very different fortunes in reception and reputation of Romantic poets, their poetry, and attacks on or defences of Romanticism as a cultural trend generally - again leaving a popular legacy that endured into the twentieth century. Material covered includes nineteenth-century journalism, early literary criticism, biography, medical and psychiatric literature, and poetry. A wide range of scientific (and pseudoscientific) thinkers are discussed alongside major Romantic authors, including Wordsworth, Coleridge, Blake, Hazlitt, Lamb, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Keats, Byron, and John Clare. Using this array of sources and figures, the book asks: was the Romantic mad genius just a sentimental stereotype or a romantic myth? Or does its long popularity tell us something serious about Romanticism and the role it has played, or has been given, in modern culture?",Literary Criticism,en,437.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=04wtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2017.0,complete

znIOEQAAQBAJ,Один на вершине. Биография самого отчаянного альпиниста нового поколения,Йост Кобуш,"ЛитРес, Эксмо",2024-06-13,"Йост Кобуш  немецкий альпинист и писатель. В 2014 году он стал самым молодым восходителем в мире, который поднялся в соло-восхождении на вершину Ама-Даблам. В 2015-м он запланировал бескислородное восхождение на Лхоцзе, но этому было не суждено сбыться из-за крупного землетрясения в Непале, которое Йост освещал у себя в соцсетях. В достаточно юном возрасте автор уже произвел фурор в мире альпинизма благодаря стилю восхождений.Кому-то Йост может показаться безбашенным смельчаком, кому-то  отчаянным парнем, ищущим опасных приключений, но чего у него точно нельзя отнять  это тяга к горам и авантюризм.Йост Кобуш взошел на такие вершины, как: 2014: Ама Даблам (Непал)  соло, без искусственного кислорода. 2016: Аннапурна (Непал)  без искусственного кислорода. 2017: Нангпай Госум II (Непал)  соло, без искусственного кислорода. 2018: Новый маршрут Путь предков, ведущий к пирамиде Карстенз (Новая Гвинея). 2019: Первовосхождение на Амотсанг (6393 м, Непал), Дамодар Гималаи. 2021: Первовосхождение на Пурбунг (6465 м, Непал) с Николасом Шайдтвейлером. 2023: Денали (Аляска)  одиночное зимнее восхождение через кулуар Месснера.В этой книге автор рассказывает не только о своих достижениях или об уроках, которые он извлек в ходе каждой экспедиции, но и об ошибках, которые могли стоить ему жизни.В формате PDF A4 сохранён издательский дизайн.",Biography & Autobiography,ru,179.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=znIOEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2024.0,complete

Norton,Simon & Schuster Books For Young Readers,1993,"Field-tested and backed by sound research, this popular methods book provides readers with a broad background in language arts, including assessment and instruction in the major areas of speaking, listening, writing, and reading. Thoroughly encompassing the 'back-to-basics' movement and the trend toward literature-based instruction, it offers clearly developed methodologies and lessons, and makes extensive use of children's actual language samples to illustrate ways literature can enhance the development of language arts skills. Written by an award-winning author, the book focuses on material that embraces the needs of all learners: linguistically-different children, multicultural children, and children with learning disabilities and handicaps. Emphasizing the importance of literature-based strategies and the identification of literature that can be applied to each of the language arts, it offers 'For Your Plan Book', a special section at the end of most chapters which provides concrete ideas, field-tested lessons and unit plans teachers can take right into their classroom. Literature chapters are now moved to the forefront of the book, enabling instructors to place a greater emphasis on literature-related language arts. Strong methodologies in the composition chapters now encompass the writing process, plus results of a five-year composition study of the relationships between writing and literature.

In addition to revising and substantially enlarging the chapters on reference sources, Li has further increased the usefulness of this reference volume by adding a chapter on geography and one on business that is distinct from economies. Since the publication of the first edition, there have been two obvious developments in information storage and retrieval: the rapid development of online databases and the development of CD-ROM. Instead of devoting a separate chapter to these developments, the book incorporates online databases, CD-ROM and other forms of data sources into the text. In addition, there is a brief introduction to these developments.

Veit",Johns Hopkins University Press,1996-01-22,"Volume XIV of this widely acclaimed series takes us to the third session of Congress in December 1790, when for the first time under the new Constitution Congress took up quarters at Philadelphia. House and Senate met in cramped Congress Hall, which, in tacit comment on the fragility of the new federal government, the nearby Pennsylvania State House overshadowed. During this session Congress debated the federal courts, state militias and the U.S. military, the postal system, navigation bills, and other issues fundamental to the new orderwhich had already begun to raise suspicions. The Virginia delegation denounced federal assumption of state debts. Congress heatedly discussed Alexander Hamilton's proposed national bankincluding whether the Constitution implied federal authority to establish one. Congress followed the secretary of the treasury in placing an excise tax on distilled spirits, a measure that soon led to open rebellion in western Pennsylvania.",History,en,1010.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AIyGAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,1996.0,complete

FRx1AAAAMAAJ,Political Leadership in New Zealand,"Raymond Miller, Michael Mintrom",,2006,"A comprehensive, up-to-date analysis of the role and influence of political leadership in New Zealand, Political Leadership in New Zealand discusses this topical issue from a variety of valuable perspectives. More than simple studies of various leaders, chapters cover leadership and national identity; leadership in response to globalisation; leadership in New Zealand foreign policy; the populist tradition of leadership; how to adapt traditional, adversarial leadership styles to MMP; Maori conceptions of political 'chieftainship'; emerging leadership of new immigrant groups; and the role of the media in reflecting and controlling the public views of leaders. Portraits of the minor-party leaders, such as Winston Peters, Jim Anderton and Peter Dunne are included, as is a fascinating comparison between the leadership styles of Helen Clark and Don Brash. Leadership is now a subject of growing interest especially since the advent of MMP and this innovative new book interrogates the theory, the practice and the personalities of political leaders in producing emotive gut-responses and intense loyalty from their followers. Contributors:Margie Comrie, Tania Domett, Seishi Gomibuchi, Barry Gustafson, John Henderson, Manying Ip, Elizabeth McLeay, Raymond Miller, Michael Mintrom, Matthew Palmer, Jacqui True, Ranginui Walker and Luke Williams; Foreword by high profile leadership expert Lester Levy",History,en,276.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FRx1AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2006.0,complete

4PzaAAAAMAAJ,Race and Medicine in Nineteenth- and Early-twentieth-century America,Todd Lee Savitt,,2007,"During the days of slavery in America, racism and often-faulty medical theories contributed to an atmosphere in which African Americans were seen as chattel: some white physicians claimed that African Americans had physiological and anatomical differences that made them well suited for slavery. These attitudes continued into the Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. In Race and Medicine, historian Todd Savitt presents revised and updated versions of his seminal essays on the medical history of African Americans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially in the South. This collection examines a variety of aspects of African American medical history, including health and illnesses, medical experimentation, early medical schools and medical professionals, and slave life insurance. Savitt examines the history of sickle-cell anemia and identifies the first two patients with the disease noted in medical literature. He proposes an explanation of why the disease was not well known in the general African American population for at least 50 years after its discovery. Charleston Low Country and not elsewhere in the country. Other topics Savitt explores include African American medical schools, the formation of an African American medical profession, and SIDS among Virginia slaves. With its new research data and interpretations of existing materials, Race and Medicine will be a valuable resource to those interested in the history of medicine and African American history as well as to the medical community.",History,en,472.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4PzaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2007.0,complete

NG9uAAAAMAAJ,Beyond the Bronze Pillars,Liam C. Kelley,,2005-01-31,"Beyond the Bronze Pillars is an innovative and iconoclastic look at the politico-cultural relationship between Vietnam and China in the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries. Overturning the established view that historically the Vietnamese sought to maintain a separate cultural identity and engaged in tributary relations with the Middle Kingdom solely to avoid invasion, Liam Kelley shows how Vietnamese literati sought to unify their cultural practices with those in China while fully recognizing their countrys political subservience. He does so by examining a body of writings known as Vietnamese ""envoy poetry."" Far from advocating their own cultural distinctiveness, Vietnamese envoy poets expressed a profound identification with what we would now call the Sinitic world and their political status as vassals in it. In mining a body of rich primary sources that no Western historian has previously employed, Kelley provides startling insights into the pre-modern Vietnamese view of their world and its politico-cultural relationship with China.",Literary Criticism,en,296.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NG9uAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,google_books_api,,2005.0,complete
